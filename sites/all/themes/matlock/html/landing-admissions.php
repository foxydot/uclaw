						<h1>Admissions</h1>
						<p class="lead">Welcome to the University of Cincinnati College of Law – the nation’s premier, small, urban, public law school. As the country’s fourth oldest continuously operating law school, we develop legal professionals ready to assume leadership roles in the global marketplace.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="span4">
								<h3>Experience</h3>
								<p>Outside of the classroom, students gain real-world experience in our numerous centers, clinics, and institutes, plus through our many externship and fellowship opportunities – some that even begin in the first year. Networking opportunities also abound including employer roundtables, information fairs, on-campus interviewing opportunities, speed chats, and Catalyst, a “micro-mentoring” program.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="span4">
								<h3>Opportunity</h3>
								<p>The Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area is home to 2 million people, over 800 law firms, and serves as headquarters for ten Fortune 500 companies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and U.S. District Court for Southern District of Ohio are both located in downtown Cincinnati, a mere two miles from the law school.</p>
							</div>
						</div>	
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="span4">
								<h3>Support</h3>
								<p>Nestled within a large public research university of over 40,000 students, you will find a small law school community of less than 400 students with an enviable 11:1 student-faculty ratio and first year sections that are among the smallest in the nation. Faculty and staff are eager to provide personal attention, while new classmates quickly form community to support each other’s success.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="span4">
								<h3>Value</h3>
								<p>With approximately $2 million awarded annually in scholarships, consistently high bar passage results, and below average student loan debt figures, Cincinnati Law provides a solid return on investment.  In addition, Forbes ranked Cincinnati as one of America’s “Best Bargain Cities” and as one of the most affordable places to live well. Students from other states also have an opportunity to participate in the Graduate Metropolitan Rate or reclassify for Ohio residency.</p>
