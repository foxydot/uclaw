						<h2>A proud tradition of diversity</h2>
						<p>We are proud of our tradition of fostering an intellectually challenging and diverse learning environment.  We introduced the nation’s first joint JD/Master’s in Women’s Studies degree program in 1995 and continue to lead and innovate with initiatives such as our Center for Race, Gender, and Social Justice.  </p>
						<p>The College of Law’s diversity statement recognizes diversity as a core value – a value that also is embraced by the University of Cincinnati.  As a public research university, UC recognizes a very broad and inclusive concept of diversity that includes commonly recognized considerations such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability status, socioeconomic status, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion and regional or national origin. The University’s Diversity Council helps to shape and implement new ideas to foster an even more welcoming and supportive environment for all.</p>  
						<p>Cincinnati Law also is committed to the idea that young people from diverse backgrounds can and should be exposed to the legal profession from an early age.  We actively participate in diversity initiatives within the legal profession that include Law & Leadership Institute, a program to help increase minority representation in Ohio’s law schools, and Summer Work Experience in Law (SWEL), a program sponsored by the Black Lawyers Association of Cincinnati-Cincinnati Bar Association Round Table, to expose minority high school and college students to careers in the law.  </p>
