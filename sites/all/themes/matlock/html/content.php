						<h1>Mission and Vision</h1>
						<h2>A visionary approach to legal education on the frontier of change</h2>
						<img src="assets/img/thumb-mission.jpg" class="img-polaroid pull-right">
						<p>New technologies, increasing global interconnectedness, and a growing dependence on interdisciplinary problem-solving are driving change in the legal profession that is fundamental.  And exciting.  </p>
						<p>Facing the frontier of change comes as nothing new to our College of Law.  Throughout our long history, our best moments have been marked by innovation and initiative.  While forms and modes of law practice will change and evolve, our society will continue to demand and value people who are highly trained and skilled in law.</p>
						<h2>Our Mission</h2>
						<p>The University of Cincinnati College of Law launches, sustains, and enriches rewarding careers for an increasingly diverse group of learners, led by a faculty known for excellent and innovative research and teaching, exceptional engagement, and a visionary approach to legal education on the frontier of change. 
						<h3>Small, Premier, Urban, Public</h3>
						<p>Our programs gain their strength and distinctiveness by our intimate scale, our deep ties to the University and the Cincinnati community, and our longstanding commitment to excellence. We strive to produce graduates who are both profession-ready and intellectually curious, and who recognize their careers are enriched by lifelong learning.</p>
						<h3>Interdisciplinary and Collaborative</h3>  
						<p>We provide a learning environment that fosters students with high expectations of themselves.  Encourages interdisciplinary and collaborative problem-solving.  Deeply appreciates both theory and practice, and sees Adoing@ as a critical catalyst.</p>  
						<h3>Career Opportunities for a Changing World</h3>  
						<p>Our curricula and programs are attentive to the changing landscape of legal careers and provide the knowledge, experience, and skills development requisite to success. </p>
						<h3>Professionalism</h3>
 						<p>To best prepare our students for life as professionals, we develop not only the traditional technical competencies of a lawyer, but the behavioral competencies that are linked to effectiveness.</p>
						<p>Our strategic plan outlines our priorities and initiatives and identifies actions to continue to advance our institution.</p>
