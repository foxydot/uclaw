          Part II of Marjorie’s article, <i>Getting a Head Start: More Intake 
          Questions and Tips for Mediators,</i> was appeared in the November/December 
          issue of Alternatives (a publication of the CPR Institute for Dispute 
          Resolution). She presented two one-day seminars, through the College 
          of Law’s Center for Practice in Negotiation and Problem Solving, at 
          the UC Alumni Center: <i>Effective Negotiation Strategy and Practice</i> 
          (with Michael Watkins (Harvard Business School)), and <i>Advanced Negotiation 
          Insights.</i> Marjorie wrote all of the original seminar materials and 
          simulations used in the seminars. </p>

        Marianna’s op ed piece opposing the most recent legislative attempt to 
        place caps on damages in medical malpractice cases was published in the 
        Cincinnati Post. Her latest <i>Legally Speaking</i> column focused on 
        the Sixth Circuit’s decision striking down Cincinnati’s Drug Exclusion 
        Zone.

          Verna is serving as a consultant to the counsel for the plaintiff in 
          <i>Doe v. University of Colorado,</i> a Title IX lawsuit claiming that 
          the University was deliberately indifferent to sexual misconduct by 
          recruits for the football team. According to the complaint, in 2001 
          football recruits sexually assaulted a female student at a party; a 
          similar incident occurred in 1997. Verna was quoted in the Colorado 
          Daily as saying that the prior incident put the University on notice 
          that there was a problem needing to be addressed. </p>
