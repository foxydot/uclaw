amended so that it is filed in the principal name of Salim Ahmed Hamdan,with Lieutenant 
Commander Charles Swift, yourself, Mr. Sharp and the others as counsel. All further 
proceedings will be filed with that caption and the docket of the case will so reflect 
without further order. Mr. Hamdan will sign the amended petition as soon as it can 
possibly be presented to him, and the signature will be deemed nunc pro tunc. This 
matter will now be referred to Judge Joyce Hens Green, who will schedule any further 
proceedings. It will be referred with a recommendation from me that she promptly turn 
her attention to the protective order situation, and with some appropriate information 
from me about where this matter appears to stand in line with the other petitions. 
This matter appears to be at the head of the line. But that is for her to decide. 
The parties will hear further from her or from this court but the case is still 
assigned to me. (Court Reporter Rachel King.) (dam, ) (Entered: 09/17/2004)
