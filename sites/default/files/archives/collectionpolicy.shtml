					<span class="subhead_bold">Purpose of Archives</span>
					
					<p align="left"> The Archives serves as a repository for items
					related to the history of the University of Cincinnati College
					of Law and Law Library. The Archives shall collect materials
					suitable for use by those researching the histories of these
					institutions. The Archives shall also be a repository for the
					papers of prominent alumni and other selected members of the
					Cincinnati legal community. </p>
					
					<p align="left"> The Rare Books Collection contains rare and scholarly
					works on law and other materials which, because of their rarity,
					age, condition, format, or uniqueness, do not circulate. </p>
					
					<p align="left"> The Archives shall make reasonable efforts to
					ensure that the original documents are preserved and protected.
					If preservation of the original is impossible or impractical,
					other methods (such as photocopying or microfilming) shall be
					used to preserve the original information. </p>
					
					<p align="left"> The Director of the Library in consultation with
					the Head of Preservation and Archives shall be responsible for
					determining the content of the collection. </p>
					
					<span class="subhead_bold">Criteria for Acquisitions</span>
					
					<p><span class="subhead_oblique">Suitability</span>: Priority shall be given to items 
					relating to the histories of the College of Law and/or the Law Library
					as well as manuscript collections of prominent alumni and
					other selected members of the Cincinnati legal community.
					Rare or fragile items which fail to meet the criteria of
					suitability may, at the discretion of the Director, be temporarily
					housed with the archival materials pending the final disposition
					of such items. </p>
					
					
					<p align="left"> <span class="subhead_oblique">Physical Condition</span>: Acceptance of 
					badly deteriorated items which are otherwise suitable shall be contingent on
					the availability of funds for restoration. Donors shall be
					actively encouraged to provide financial assistance for the
					restoration and preservation of these items. </p>
					
					<p align="left"> <span class="subhead_oblique">Duplication</span>: Items which duplicate 
					materials already accessible to researchers in this or other collections
					shall be acquired and preserved only at the discretion of
					the Director. </p>
					
					<p align="left"> <span class="subhead_oblique">Items on Permanent Loan</span>: 
					The Archives will not accept items on permanent loan because of the administrative
					complications involved in caring for collections whose title
					is held elsewhere. </p>
					
					<span class="subhead_bold">Collection Areas/Formats</span>
					
					<p>Printed materials, including:
					
					<ul class="checklist">
					
						<li>books, booklets, brochures, newsletters, newspapers, reports, meeting minutes </li>
						<li>Photographs, including originals, negatives, slides, </li>
						
						<li> Magnetic media, including audio and videotapes, and electronic media </li>
						<li> Manuscript collections which may include papers, correspondence, publications, </li>
						<li>books, photographs, audio and
