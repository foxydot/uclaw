	  <p class="indent">The cases documented in this depository
        of court records and related materials all involve the detention of individuals
        in military prisons without charge or access to a lawyer. The individuals
        -- enemy combatants -- are suspected of plotting and/or taking part in
        hostile actions against the property and nationals of the United States,
        civilian and military. It is alleged that the enemy combatants are associated
        with al Qaeda or some other jihadist group that is engaging in a &quot;war
	    of terror&quot; against the United States.</p>
      <p class="indent">At issue before the U.S. Supreme Court is whether the Executive Branch
      has the unilateral power to detain indefinitely, without charge or access
      to a lawyer, enemy combatants who are (1) American citizens seized in a
      civilian setting in the United States or (2) foreign nationals captured
      in foreign lands and detained by the U.S. military. These cases raise significant
      questions about the balance between national security and individual liberty
    under the rule of law for both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals. </p>
