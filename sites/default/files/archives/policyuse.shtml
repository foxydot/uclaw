              <p>Each researcher will be asked to complete a reader registration
                form on his or her first visit to use the rare books or materials
                in the archives and to provide two forms of identification, at
                least one of which contains a photograph and current address. The
                I.D. will be held until all material is returned, counted and checked
                for damage.</p>
          
              <p>Researchers must call in advance to make an appointment to do
                research with our specialized materials. A minimum of 24 hours
                is preferred.</p>
  	     
              <p>Researchers must sign a daily register each day. Signing the register
                is an indication that the patron understands the rules of the department
                and is willing to abide by them. No materials will be pulled until
                the daily register has been signed.</p>
  	     
              <p>Researchers are responsible for the safeguarding of the materials
                made available for their use. Researchers may not remove materials
                from the designated reading room for any purpose or rearrange the
                order in which they are delivered. Remove only one folder at a
                time from a manuscript box. If a mistake in arrangement is suspected,
                call it to the attention of the staff.</p>
  	      
              <p>Only those books and papers necessary for research are permitted
                in the reading room. Coats, umbrellas, purses, briefcases, backpacks,
                carrying cases, portfolios, and other items not expressly needed
                for research much be deposited in the Technical Services working
                room. As a security measure, the archives reserves the right to
                inspect all items removed from the reading room.</p>
  	     
              <p>Archives and Rare Book Room tables are reserved for the use of
                archives materials and other items necessary for research and note
                taking. Eating, drinking, smoking, and gum chewing are not permitted.</p>
  	     
              <p class="subhead_bold">All archives materials are non-circulating and must be consulted
                only in the archives reading room.</p>
  	     
              <p>A finding aid is available for each collection. Based on an examination
                of the finding aids, a request must be made for each item or group
                of items to facilitate its retrieval and to establish responsibility
                for its use.</p>
  	      
              <p>Normally, a researcher will be limited to the use of no more than
                two rare books or materials from one archival container at a time.</p>
  	     
              <p>Researchers must exercise all possible care to prevent damage
                to the materials they use. Materials must not be marked on, folded,
                traced, or handled in any way likely to damage them. Loose sheets
                and book pages must be handled by their edges to avoid soiling
                the surface of the paper. Documents and volumes must lie flat on
                the table. They must not be placed in the lap or propped against
                the edge of the table. Do not keep a book open with other objects
                or rest hands or arms on the pages since acid from skin can be
                damaging to the paper. Never lay open books face down on the table
                or piled on top of one another. Turn pages slowly and carefully.</p>
  	      
              <p class="subhead_bold">Persons found to be involved in the mutilation, destruction, or
                theft of materials are subject to prosecution. </p>
  	      
              <p class="subhead_bold">No ink may be used. A pencil will be provided if the researcher
                does not have one.</p>
  	     
              <p>The Law Library will consider requests for the photoduplication
                of material when such duplication can be done without injury to
                the material, and does not violate copyright restrictions. Single
                copies may be provided for the researcher's personal reference
                use. The photocopy must not be further reproduced. Supplying a
                photocopy is not an authorization to publish.</p>
  	      
              <p>Please bring any damaged material to our attention so that we
                can arrange for an evaluation of the material.</p>
  	      
              <p>If a donor has placed restrictions on donated materials, those
                restrictions will be observed.</p>
  	    
              <p>Exclusive rights to examine or publish material will not be granted.</p>
  	      
              <p>If the results of research citing the manuscript collections are
                published, one copy of the publication must be sent to the Law
                Library as a record. </p>
