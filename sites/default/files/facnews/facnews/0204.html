        Marjorie served as Program Chair of the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution 
        Conference in Seattle Washington in early April. At the Seattle Conference, 
        she taught a conference session entitled "Ethics Behind Closed Doors" 
        - on ethical and moral dilemmas that arise in a mediation's private caucus. 
        Back at UC, Marjorie designed and taught (with James Lawrence on April 
        11-12, 18-19) a CLE program for practicing lawyers, entitled: Making Mediators: 
        A Practice Workshop. Students enrolled in the College of Law's Mediation 
        Advocacy Course served as lawyers and clients for the workshop's lawyer-mediators.

        Marianna and Ronna Greff Schneider gave presentations at the Ohio Judicial 
        College as part of the mandatory Continuing Judicial Education requirement 
        for judges. Marianna spoke on State Constitutional Law: Emerging from 
        the Federal Shadow. Ronna’s topic was The Courts and Religion: Clarity 
        or Confusion? They have been asked to repeat their presentations at the 
        summer session of the state court of appeals judges' association. </font></p>

        Marianna arranged for and joined local lawyers in preparing practitioner

        two women want to combine several letters of each of their last names 
        so that they and their children can all share a common surname. The request 
        was denied by the lower courts. The case, In the Matter of Jennifer Lane

        Paul began his stint as a Visiting Professor of Law teaching Estate and 
        Gift Tax in the New York University School of Law/Internal Revenue Service 
        Continuing Professional Education Program in Washington, D.C. In his capacity 
        as Series Editor for Foundation Press’s new Law Stories series patterned 
        after his forthcoming <i>Tax Stories</i> book, Paul is working with Editors 
        developing six books for the first year curriculum: <i>Civil Procedure 
        Stories</i> (Kevin Clermont (Cornell)), <i>Constitutional Law Stories</i> 
        (Michael Dorf (Columbia)), <i>Contracts Stories</i> (Douglas Baird (Chicago)), 
        <i>Criminal Law Stories</i> (Robert Weisberg (Stanford)), <i>Property 
        Stories</i> (Gerald Korngold & Andrew Morriss (Case Western), and <i>Torts 
        Stories</i> (Robert Rabin (Stanford) & Stephen Sugarman (UC-Berkeley). 
        Paul was one of the few tax professors quoted in <i>Quotations About Taxes,</i> 
        95 Tax Notes 395 (2002): “The tax bar is commonly referred to as a ‘special 
        priesthood,’ and it is only slightly more tolerant than the Catholic Church 
        in ordaining women tax priests” (from his article, <i>Tax Myopia, Or Mamas 
        Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Tax Lawyers,</i> 13 Va. Tax Rev. 517 
        (1994)). Paul published several issues of his <i>Tax Law Abstracts</i> 
        e-journals (<a href="http://www.ssrn.com">www.ssrn.com</a>): four issues 
        of <i>Tax Law & Policy</i> (vol. 3, nos. 12-15) and <i>Practitioner Series</i>
