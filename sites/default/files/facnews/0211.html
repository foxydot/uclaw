          At the invitation of the Ohio Supreme Court, Marjorie presented a one-day 
          tailored negotiation workshop for Ohio State magistrates at the Mohican 
          State Park. The workshop included original written materials, created 
          in consultation with various magistrates. The first half of her two-part 
          article, <i>Initial Contacts in Mediation,</i> was published in Alternatives 
          (a publication of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution). Marjorie 
          accompanied and "coached" UC's winning student negotiation competitors 
          at the ABA Regionals at the University of Louisville, Brandeis Law School. 
          Marjorie and Adjunct Professor Jim Lawrence also coached our students 
          in preparation for the competition, and Marjorie facilitated a practice 
          session at Keating, Muething &amp; Klecamp, hosted by Dan Donnellen.
