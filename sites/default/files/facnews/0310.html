Marjorie conducted an internal negotiation competition to select two teams to
  represent the College of Law at the midwestern regionals for the ABA negotiation
  competition. Twenty three Cincinnati lawyers served as judges and 31 students
  negotiated through two competition rounds. With the assistance of adjunct professor
  Jim Lawrence, she has begun coaching our two winning teams in preparation for
  the regionals on November 8-9 in Louisville. Marjorie also taught a two hour
  CLE program on Mediation Ethics for the Cincinnati Bar Association. Her article, <em>Using
  Decision Trees as Tools for Settlement,</em> 14 Alternatives to High Cost Litigation
  71 (1996) (with David P. Hoffer), was cited in the October 2003 update of Robert
  L. Haig, <em>Successful Partnering Between Inside and Outside Counsel</em> (West Group,
  2000).</p>

  Marianna spoke on <em>The Problems with Electing Judges in Ohio</em> at the
  Isaac M. Wise Temple. She wrote her monthly Israelite column on <em>State v.
  Brown,</em> a case in which the Ohio Supreme Court departed from its usual
  custom in following the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
  and instead held that a full custodial arrest for the minor misdemeanor of
  jaywalking violates the Ohio Constitution&#8217;s prohibition against unreasonable
  searches and seizures. Marianna served as a panelist on a Cincinnati Bar Association
  CLE ethics program. </p>

  Chris lectured and led a discussion among over one-hundred secondary school
    teachers at the 13th annual Law and Citizenship Conference sponsored by the
    Ohio Center for Law-Related Education and held in Columbus, OH. He addressed
    the history and contours of the privilege against self-incrimination, which
    will be the focus of a state-wide mock-trial program for high school students
    in the coming year. </p>
