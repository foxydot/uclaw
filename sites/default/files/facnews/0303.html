          Marjorie and Adjunct Professor Jim Lawrence did something Bob Huggins 
          and Tubby Smith were unable to do: they coached two UC students (Patti 
          Foster ’05 and Susie Coan ’05) to a victory over Marquette in the finals 
          of the <i>National Representation in Mediation Competition</i> at the 
          annual meeting of the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution (<a href="http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.asp?id=382">www.uc.edu/news/NR.asp?id=382</a>). 
          Marjorie and Adjunct Professor Jim Lawrence also co-taught a CLE workshop 
          for 12 Cincinnati lawyers on Making Mediators. The workshop dovetailed 
          with her Mediation Advocacy course, which enabled her students to play 
          lawyer and client roles in two reasonably complex and realistic mediation 
          simulations, with the CLE participants serving in the mediators’ roles. 
          Marjorie taught a session, <i>On the Job: Challenges in Employment Mediation,</i> 
          (with Margaret Shaw, a New York City mediator and adjunct professor) 
          at the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution’s annual conference. She also 
          was invited to participate in a video-tape project designed to collect 
          short "advice" from well respected mediators from across the country. 
          Marjorie provided comments on three topics (two on process design and 
          one on mediation ethics. </p>
