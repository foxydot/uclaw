The Task Force, co-chaired by Patrick Fischer, President of the Cincinnati Bar Association (and partner at Keating, Muething & Klekamp) and Judge John Bessey, was appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court to assess the best method of establishing commercial civil litigation dockets in the courts of common pleas in Ohio and to develop, oversee and evaluate a pilot project. Barbara met with the Task Force members and 2Ls Philip Borger and Nicklaus McKee are working full-time this summer on this ongoing project.</p>
