If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or an application that is denied, an opt out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.<br><br><LI type="i"><a name="a.3.ii"></a>Examples of isolated transactions. An isolated transaction occurs if:<br><br><OL Type="A"><LI type="A"><a name="a.3.ii.A"></a>The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash from an account at another financial institution; or<br><br><LI type="A"><a name="a.3.ii.B"></a>A broker-dealer opens a brokerage account for the consumer solely for the purpose of liquidating or purchasing securities as an accommodation, i.e., on a one-time basis, without the expectation of engaging in other transactions.<br><br></ol></ol><LI type="1"><a name="a.4"></a>Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit marketing solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit marketing solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all marketing solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.<br><br><LI type="1"><a name="a.5"></a>Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships.<br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><a name="a.5.i"></a>In general. A consumer must be given a new opt out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a marketing solicitation. The new opt out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with  paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt out notice would not override a prior opt out election by the consumer  that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt out notice applies to eligibility  information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.<br> <br><LI type="i"><a name="a.5.ii"></a>Example. A consumer has an advisory contract with a company that is registered with the Commission as both a broker-dealer and an investment adviser, and that is part of an affiliated group. The consumer terminates the advisory contract. One year after terminating the advisory contract, the consumer opens a brokerage account with the same company. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to opt out before the company's affiliates may  make marketing solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the company in connection with the new brokerage account relationship,   regardless of whether the consumer opted out in connection with the advisory contract.<br>  <br>  </ol> </ol><LI type="a"><a name="b"></a>Duration of opt out. The election of a consumer to opt out must be effective for a period of at least five years (the "opt out period") beginning when the consumer's opt out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt out in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt out period of more than five years may be established, including an opt out period that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.<br><br><LI type="a"><a name="c"></a>Time of opt out.
