Target Companies</b><p><u>Facts</u>: Company X proposes to file a registration statement covering  an exchange offer to stockholders of Company Y, a publicly held company. Company  X asks Company Y to furnish information about its business, including current  audited financial statements, for inclusion in the prospectus. Company Y declines  to furnish such information.<p><u>Question 1</u>: In filing the registration statement without the required  information about Company Y, may Company X rely on Rule 409 in that the information  is &quot;unknown or not reasonably available?&quot;<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Yes, but to determine whether such reliance  is justified, the staff requests the registrant to submit as supplemental information  copies of correspondence between the registrant and the target company evidencing  the request for and the refusal to furnish the financial statements. In addition,  the prospectus must include any financial statements which are relevant and  available from the Commission's public files and must contain a statement adequately  describing the situation and the sources of information about the target company.  Other reliable sources of financial information should also be utilized.<p><u>Question 2</u>: Would the response change if Company Y was a closely held  company?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Yes. The staff does not believe that <a href="../33ActRls/rule409.html">Rule    409</a>  is applicable to negotiated transactions of this type.<p><b><a name="1.B"></a> B. Allocation Of Expenses And Related Disclosure In Financial    Statements Of Subsidiaries, Divisions Or Lesser Business Components Of Another    Entity</b><p><u>Facts</u>: A company (the registrant) operates as a subsidiary of another  company (parent). Certain expenses incurred by the parent on behalf of the  subsidiary have not been charged to the subsidiary in the past. The subsidiary  files a registration statement under the <a href="../33ActRls/index.html">Securities  Act of 1933</a> in connection  with an initial public offering.<p><a name="1.B.1"></a><b>1.<u> Costs reflected in historical financial statements</u></b><p><u>Question 1</u>: Should the subsidiary's historical income statements reflect  all of the expenses that the parent incurred on its behalf?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: In general, the staff believes that the historical  income statements of a registrant should reflect all of its costs of doing  business. Therefore, in specific situations, the staff has required the subsidiary  to revise its financial statements to include certain expenses incurred by  the parent on its behalf. Examples of such expenses may include, but are not  necessarily limited to, the following (income taxes and interest are discussed  separately below):<ol>  <p>  <li> Officer and employee salaries,      <p>  <li> Rent or depreciation,        <p>  <li> Advertising,            <p>  <li> Accounting and legal services, and                    <p>  <li> Other selling, general and administrative                                  expenses.</ol><p>When the subsidiary's financial statements have been previously reported on  by independent accountants and have been used other than for internal purposes,  the staff has accepted a presentation that shows income before tax as previously  reported, followed by adjustments for expenses not previously allocated, income  taxes, and adjusted net income.<p><u>Question 2</u>: How should the amount of expenses incurred on the subsidiary's  behalf by its parent be determined, and what disclosure is required in the  financial statements?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff expects any expenses clearly applicable  to the subsidiary to be reflected in its income statements. However, the staff  understands that in some situations a reasonable method of allocating common  expenses to the subsidiary (e.g., incremental or proportional cost allocation)  must be chosen because specific identification of expenses is not practicable.  In these situations, the staff has required an explanation of the allocation  method used in the notes to the financial statements along with management's  assertion that the method used is reasonable.<p>In addition, since agreements with related parties are by definition not at  arms length and may be changed at any time, the staff has required footnote  disclosure, when practicable, of management's estimate of what the expenses  (other than income taxes and interest discussed separately below) would have  been on a stand alone basis, that is, the cost that would have been incurred  if the subsidiary had operated as an unaffiliated entity. The disclosure has  been presented for each year for which an income statement was required when  such basis produced materially different results.<p><u>Question 3</u>: What are the staff's views with respect to the accounting  for and disclosure of the subsidiary's income tax expense?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Recently, a number of parent companies have  sold interests in subsidiaries, but have retained sufficient ownership interests  to permit continued inclusion of the subsidiaries in their consolidated tax  returns. The staff believes that it is material to investors to know what the  effect on income would have been if the registrant had not been eligible to  be included in a consolidated income tax return with its parent. Some of these  subsidiaries have calculated their tax provision on the separate return basis,  which the staff believes is the preferable method. Others, however, have used  different allocation methods. When the historical income statements in the  filing do not reflect the tax provision on the separate return basis, the staff  has required a pro forma income statement for the most recent year and interim  period reflecting a tax provision calculated on the separate return basis.<sup><a href="#P407_54436" name="P407_54437">1</a></sup><p><u>Question 4</u>: Should the historical income statements reflect a charge  for interest on intercompany debt if no such charge had been previously provided?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff generally believes that financial  statements are more useful to investors if they reflect all costs of doing  business, including interest costs. Because of the inherent difficulty in distinguishing  the elements of a subsidiary's capital structure, the staff has not insisted  that the historical income statements include an interest charge on intercompany  debt if such a charge was not provided in the past, except when debt specifically  related to the operations of the subsidiary and previously carried on the parent's  books will henceforth be recorded in the subsidiary's books. In any case, financing  arrangements with the parent must be discussed in a note to the financial statements.  In this connection, the staff has taken the position that, where an interest  charge on intercompany debt has not been provided, appropriate disclosure would  include an analysis of the intercompany accounts as well as the average balance  due to or from related parties for each period for which an income statement  is required. The analysis of the intercompany accounts has taken the form of  a listing of transactions (e.g., the allocation of costs to the subsidiary,  intercompany purchases, and cash transfers between entities) for each period  for which an income statement was required, reconciled to the intercompany  accounts reflected in the balance sheets.<p><a name="1.B.2"></a><b>2.<u> Pro forma financial statements and earnings per      share</u></b><p><u>Question</u>: What disclosure should be made if the registrant's historical  financial statements are not indicative of the ongoing entity (e.g., tax or  other cost sharing agreements will be terminated or revised)?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The registration statement should include pro  forma financial information that is in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation  S-X and reflects the impact of terminated or revised cost sharing agreements  and other significant changes.<p><a name="1.B.3"></a><b>3.<u> Other matters</u></b><p><u>Question</u>: What is the staff's position with respect to dividends declared  by the subsidiary subsequent to the balance sheet date?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff believes that such dividends either  be given retroactive effect in the balance sheet with appropriate footnote  disclosure, or reflected in a pro forma balance sheet. In addition, when the  dividends are to be paid from the proceeds of the offering, the staff believes  it is appropriate to include pro forma per share data (for the latest year  and interim period only) giving effect to the number of shares whose proceeds  were to be used to pay the dividend. A similar presentation is appropriate  when dividends exceed earnings in the current year, even though the stated  use of proceeds is other than for the payment of dividends. In these situations,  pro forma per share data should give effect to the increase in the number of  shares which, when multiplied by the offering price, would be sufficient to  replace the capital in excess of earnings being withdrawn.<p><b><a name="1.C"></a>C. Unaudited Financial Statements For A Full Fiscal Year</b><p><u>Facts</u>: Company A, which is a reporting company under the <a href="../34Act/index.html">Securities  Exchange Act of 1934</a>, proposes to file a registration statement within 90 days  of its fiscal year end but does not have audited year-end financial statements  available.&#160; The company meets the criteria under <a href="../regS-X/SX3-01.html#c">Rule  3-01(c)</a> of Regulation  S-X and is therefore not required to include year-end audited financial statements  in its registration statement.&#160; However, the Company does propose to include  in the prospectus the unaudited results of operations for its entire fiscal  year.<p><u>Question</u>: Would the staff find this objectionable?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff recognizes that many registrants publish  the results of their most recent year's operations prior to the availability  of year-end audited financial statements. The staff will not object to the  inclusion of unaudited results for a full fiscal year and indeed would expect  such data in the registration statement if the registrant has published such  information. When such data is included in a prospectus, it must be covered  by a management's representation that all adjustments necessary for a fair  statement of the results have been made.<p><b><a name="1.D"></a>D. Foreign Companies</b></p><p><a name="1.D.1"></a><b>1.<u> Disclosures required of companies complying with      Item 17 of Form 20-F</u></b><p><u>Facts</u>: A foreign private issuer may use Form 20-F as a registration  statement under <a href="../34Act/sec12.html">section 12</a> or as an annual report under <a href="../34Act/sec13.html#a">section  13(a)</a> or <a href="../34Act/sec15.html#d">15(d)</a>  of the Exchange Act. The registrant must furnish the financial statements specified  in Item 17 of that form. However, in certain circumstances, Forms F-3 and F-2  require that the annual report include financial statements complying with  Item 18 of the form. Also, financial statements complying with Item 18 are  required for registration of securities under the Securities Act in most circumstances.  Item 17 permits the registrant to use its financial statements that are prepared  on a comprehensive basis other than U.S. GAAP, but requires quantification  of the material differences in the principles, practices and methods of accounting.  An issuer complying with Item 18 must satisfy the requirements of Item 17 and  also must provide all other information required by U.S. GAAP and <a href="../regS-X/index.html">Regulation  S-X</a>.<p><u>Question</u>: Assuming that the registrant's financial statements include  a discussion of material variances from U.S. GAAP along with quantitative reconciliations  of net income and material balance sheet items, does Item 17 of Form 20-F require  other disclosures in addition to those prescribed by the standards and practices  which comprise the comprehensive basis on which the registrant's primary financial  statements are prepared?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: No. The distinction between Items 17 and 18  is premised on a classification of the requirements of U.S. GAAP and <a href="../regS-X/index.html">Regulation  S-X</a> into those that specify the methods of measuring the amounts shown on the  face of the financial statements and those prescribing disclosures that explain,  modify or supplement the accounting measurements. Disclosures required by U.S.  GAAP but not required under the foreign GAAP on which the financial statements  are prepared need not be furnished pursuant to Item 17.<p>Notwithstanding the absence of a requirement for certain disclosures within  the body of the financial statements, some matters routinely disclosed pursuant  to U.S. GAAP may rise to a level of materiality such that their disclosure  is required by Item 5 (Management's Discussion and Analysis) of Form 20-F.  Among other things, this item calls for a discussion of any known trends, demands,  commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity,  capital resources or the results of operations in a material way. Also, instruction  2 of this item requires &quot;a discussion of any aspects of the differences  between foreign and U.S. GAAP, not discussed in the reconciliation, that the  registrant believes is necessary for an understanding of the financial statements  as a whole.&quot; Matters that may warrant discussion in response to Item 5  include the following:<ul>  <p>  <li> material undisclosed uncertainties (such as reasonably possible loss contingencies),    commitments (such as those arising from leases), and credit risk exposures    and concentrations;      <p>  <li> material unrecognized obligations (such as pension obligations);        <p>  <li> material changes in estimates and accounting methods, and other          factors or events affecting comparability;            <p>  <li> defaults on debt and material restrictions on dividends or other legal constraints on the registrant's use of its assets;<p>  <li> material changes in the relative amounts of constituent elements comprising line items presented on the face of the financial statements;<p>  <li> significant terms of financings which would reveal material cash requirements or constraints; <p>  <li> material subsequent events, such as events that affect the recoverability of recorded assets;<p>  <li> material related party transactions (as addressed by Statement 57)that may affect theterms under which material revenues or expenses are recorded;and<p>  <li>significant accounting policies and measurement assumptions not disclosed in the financial statements, including methods of costing inventory, recognizing revenues, and recording and amortizing assets,  which may bear upon an understanding of operating trends or financial condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                condition.</ul><p><a name="1.D.2"></a><b>2.<u> &quot;Free distributions&quot; by Japanese companies</u></b><p><u>Facts</u>: It is the general practice in Japan for corporations to issue &quot;free  distributions&quot; of common stock to existing shareholders in conjunction  with offerings of common stock so that such offerings may be made at less than  market. These free distributions usually are from 5 to 10 percent of outstanding  stock and are accounted for in accordance with provisions of the Commercial  Code of Japan by a transfer of the par value of the stock distributed from  paid-in capital to the common stock account.&#160; Similar distributions are  sometimes made at times other than when offering new stock and are also designated &quot;free  distributions.&quot; U.S. accounting practice would require that the fair value  of such shares, if issued by U.S. companies, be transferred from retained earnings  to the appropriate capital accounts.<p><u>Question</u>: Should the financial statements of Japanese corporations  included in Commission filings which are stated to be prepared in accordance  with U.S. GAAP be adjusted to account for stock distributions of less than  25 percent of outstanding stock by transferring the fair value of such stock  from retained earnings to appropriate capital accounts?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: If registrants and their independent accountants  believe that the institutional and economic environment in Japan with respect  to the registrant is sufficiently different that U.S. accounting principles  for stock dividends should not apply to free distributions, the staff will  not object to such distributions being accounted for at par value in accordance  with Japanese practice. If such financial statements are identified as being  prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, then there should be footnote disclosure  of the method being used which indicates that U.S. companies issuing shares  in comparable amounts would be required to account for them as stock dividends,  and including in such disclosure the fair value of any such shares issued during  the year and the cumulative amount (either in an aggregate figure or a listing  of the amounts by year) of the fair value of shares issued over time. <b>  <p><a name="1e"></a>E.

This position was discussed in ASR 90 in connection with representations  concerning the verification of prior years' inventories in first audits.<p>Financial statements for which the auditors' opinions contain qualifications  relating to the acceptability of accounting principles used or the completeness  of disclosures made are also unacceptable.

Financial Statement Requirements In Filings Involving    The Formation Of A One-Bank Holding Company</b><p><u>Facts</u>: Holding Company A is organized for the purpose of issuing common  stock to acquire all of the common stock of Bank A. Under the plan of reorganization,  each share of common stock of Bank A will be exchanged for one share of common  stock of the holding company. The shares of the holding company to be issued  in the transaction will be registered on Form S-4. The holding company will  not engage in any operations prior to consummation of the reorganization, and  its only significant asset after the transaction will be its investment in  the bank. The bank has been furnishing its shareholders with an annual report  that includes financial statements that comply with GAAP.<p>Item 14 of Schedule 14A of the proxy rules provides that financial statements  generally are not necessary in proxy material relating only to changes in legal  organization (such as reorganizations involving the issuer and one or more  of its totally held subsidiaries).<p><u>Question 1</u>: Must the financial statements and the information required  by Securities Act Industry Guide (&quot;Guide 3&quot;)<sup><a href="#P450_67921" name="P450_67922">2</a></sup> for  Bank A be included in the initial registration statement on Form S-4?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: No, provided that certain conditions are met.  The staff will not take exception to the omission of financial statements and  Guide 3 information in the initial registration statement on Form S-4 if all  of the following conditions are met:<ul>  <p>  <li> There are no anticipated changes in the shareholders' relative equity    ownership interest in the underlying bank assets, except for redemption of    no more than a nominal number of shares of unaffiliated persons who dissent;      <p>  <li> In the aggregate, only nominal borrowings are to be incurred for such      purposes as organizing the holding company, to pay nonaffiliated persons      who dissent, or to meet minimum capital requirements;        <p>  <li> There are no new classes of stock authorized other than those corresponding          to the stock of Bank A immediately prior to the reorganization;            <p>  <li> There are no plans or arrangements to issue any additional shares to acquire any business other than Bank A; and,<p>  <li> There has been no material adverse change in the financial condition of the bank sincethe latest fiscal year-end included in the annual report to shareholders.</ul><p>If at the time of filing the S-4, a letter is furnished to the staff stating  that all of these conditions are met, it will not be necessary to request the  Division of Corporation Finance to waive the financial statement or Guide 3  requirements of Form S-4.<p>Although the financial statements may be omitted, the filing should include  a section captioned, &quot;Financial Statements,&quot; which states either  that an annual report containing financial statements for at least the latest  fiscal year prepared in conformity with GAAP was previously furnished to shareholders  or is being delivered with the prospectus. If financial statements have been  previously furnished, it should be indicated that an additional copy of such  report for the latest fiscal year will be furnished promptly upon request without  charge to shareholders. The name and address of the person to whom the request  should be made should be provided. One copy of such annual report should be  furnished supplementally with the initial filing for purposes of staff review.<p>If any nominal amounts are to be borrowed in connection with the formation  of the holding company, a statement of capitalization should be included in  the filing which shows Bank A on an historical basis, the pro forma adjustments,  and the holding company on a pro forma basis. A note should also explain the  pro forma effect, in total and per share, which the borrowings would have had  on net income for the latest fiscal year if the transaction had occurred at  the beginning of the period.<p><u>Question 2</u>: Are the financial statements of Bank A required to be audited  for purposes of the initial Form S-4 or the subsequent Form 10-K report?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff will not insist that the financial  statements in the annual report to shareholders used to satisfy the requirement  of the initial Form S-4 be audited.<p>The consolidated financial statements of the holding company to be included  in the registrant's initial report on Form 10-K should comply with the applicable  financial statement requirements in Regulation S-X at the time such annual  report is filed. However, the regulations also provide that the staff may allow  one or more of the required statements to be unaudited where it is consistent  with the protection of investors.<sup><a href="#P463_71402" name="P463_71403">3</a></sup> Accordingly,  the policy of the Division of Corporation Finance is as follows:<ul>  <p>  <li> The registrant should file audited balance sheets as of the two most recent    fiscal years and audited statements of income and cash flows for each of    the three latest fiscal years, with appropriate footnotes and schedules as    required by <a href="../regS-X/index.html">Regulation S-X</a> unless the financial statements have not previously    been audited for the periods required to be filed.

In all cases, however, information  with respect to nonperforming loans and loan loss experience, or reasonably  comparable data, must be furnished for at least the two latest fiscal years  in the initial 10-K. Thereafter, for subsequent years in reports on Form 10-K,  all of the Guide 3 information is required; Guide 3 information which had been  omitted in the initial 10-K in accordance with the above procedure can be excluded  in any subsequent 10-Ks.<p><b>G.

Proceeds  of the offering will be placed in escrow until $1 million of securities are  sold at which point escrow may be broken, making the proceeds immediately available  for lending, while the selling of securities would continue.<p><u>Question 1</u>: Under what circumstances are the financial statements of  a property on which the registrant makes or expects to make a loan required  to be included in a filing?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: <a href="../regS-X/SX3-14.html">Rule 3-14</a> of Regulation S-X specifies the requirements  for financial statements when the registrant has acquired one or more properties  which in the aggregate are significant, or since the date of the latest balance  sheet required has acquired or proposes to acquire one or more properties which  in the aggregate are significant.<p>Included in the category of properties acquired or to be acquired under Rule  3-14 are operating properties underlying certain mortgage loans, which in economic  substance represent an investment in real estate or a joint venture rather  than a loan. Certain characteristics of a lending arrangement indicate that  the &quot;lender&quot; has the same risks and potential rewards as an owner  or joint venturer. Those characteristics are set forth in Exhibit I to the  Appendix of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Practice  Bulletin 1<sup><a href="#P476_75484" name="P476_75485">6</a></sup> &quot;ADC<sup><a href="#P477_75830" name="P477_75831">7</a></sup> Arrangements&quot; (&quot;Exhibit  I to PB1&quot;). In September 1986 the EITF<sup><a href="#P478_75939" name="P478_75940">8</a></sup> reached  a consensus on this issue<sup><a href="#P479_76302" name="P479_76303">9</a></sup> to  the effect that, although Exhibit I to PB1 was issued to address the real estate  ADC arrangements of financial institutions, preparers and auditors should consider  the guidance contained in Exhibit I to PB1 in accounting for shared appreciation  mortgages, loans on operating real estate and real estate ADC arrangements  entered into by enterprises other than financial institutions.<p>Statement 133 as amended by Statements 137 and 138, generally requires that  embedded instruments meeting the definition of a derivative and not clearly  and closely related to the host contract be accounted for separately from the  host instrument. If the embedded the expected residual profit component of  an ADC arrangement need not be separately accounted for as a derivative under  Statement 133, then the disclosure requirements discussed below for ADC loans  and similar arrangements should be followed.<sup><a href="#P481_77213" name="P481_77214">10</a></sup><p>In certain cases the &quot;lender&quot; has virtually the same potential rewards  as those of an owner or a joint venturer by virtue of participating in expected  residual profit.<sup><a href="#P483_77757" name="P483_77758">11</a></sup> <sup> </sup>In  addition, Exhibit I to PB1 includes a number of other characteristics which,  when considered individually or in combination, would suggest that the risks  of an ADC arrangement are similar to those associated with an investment in  real estate or a joint venture or, conversely, that they are similar to those  associated with a loan. Among those other characteristics is whether the lender  agrees to provide all or substantially all necessary funds to acquire the property,  resulting in the borrower having title to, but little or no equity in, the  underlying property. The staff believes that the borrower's equity in the property  is adequate to support accounting for the transaction as a mortgage loan when  the borrower's initial investment meets the criteria in paragraph 11 of Statement  66<sup><a href="#P484_78790" name="P484_78791">12</a></sup> and the borrower's  payments of principal and interest on the loan are adequate to maintain a continuing  investment in the property which meets the criteria in paragraph 12 of Statement  66.<sup><a href="#P485_79432" name="P485_79433">13</a></sup><p>The financial statements of properties which will secure mortgage loans made  or to be made from the proceeds of the offering which have the characteristics  of real estate investments or joint ventures should be included as required  by Rule 3-14 in the registration statement when such properties secure loans  previously made, or have been identified as security for probable loans prior  to effectiveness, and in filings made pursuant to the undertaking in Item 20D  of Securities Act Industry Guide 5.<p><a href="../regS-X/SX1-02.html#w">Rule 1-02(w)</a> of Regulation S-X includes the conditions used in determining  whether an acquisition is significant. The separate financial statements of  an individual property should be provided when a property would meet the requirements  for a significant subsidiary under this rule using the amount of the &quot;loan&quot; as  a substitute for the &quot;investment in the subsidiary&quot; in computing  the specified conditions. The combined financial statements of properties which  are not individually significant should also be provided. However, the staff  will not object if the combined financial statements of such properties are  not included if none of the conditions specified in Rule 1-02(w), with respect  to all such properties combined, exceeds 20% in the aggregate.<p>Under certain circumstances, information may also be required regarding operating  properties underlying mortgage loans where the terms do not result in the lender  having virtually the same risks and potential rewards as those of owners or  joint venturers. Generally, the staff believes that, where investment risks  exist due to substantial asset concentration, financial and other information  should be included regarding operating properties underlying a mortgage loan  that represents a significant amount of the registrant's assets. Such presentation  is consistent with <a href="../regS-X/SX3-13.html">Rule 3-13</a> of Regulation S-X and <a href="../33ActRls/rule408.html">Rule  408</a> under the Securities  Act of 1933.<p>Where the amount of a loan exceeds 20% of the amount in good faith expected  to be raised in the offering, disclosures would be expected to consist of financial  statements for the underlying operating properties for the periods contemplated  by Rule 3-14. Further, where loans on related properties are made to a single  person or group of affiliated persons which in the aggregate amount to more  than 20% of the amount expected to be raised, the staff believes that such  lending arrangements result in a sufficient concentration of assets so as to  warrant the inclusion of financial and other information regarding the underlying  properties.<p><u>Question 2</u>: Will the financial statements of the mortgaged properties  be required in filings made under the 1934 Act?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: <a href="../regS-X/SX3-09.html">Rule 3-09</a> of Regulation S-X specifies the requirement  for significant, as defined, investments in operating entities, the operations  of which are not included in the registrant's consolidated financial statements.<sup><a href="#P492_82887" name="P492_82888">14</a></sup> Accordingly,  the staff believes that the financial statements of properties securing significant  loans which have the characteristics of real estate investments or joint ventures  should be included in subsequent filings as required by Rule 3-09. The materiality  threshold for determining whether such an investment is significant is the  same as set forth in paragraph (a) of that Rule.<sup><a href="#P493_84029" name="P493_84030">15</a></sup><p>Likewise, the staff believes that filings made under the <a href="../34Act/index.html">1934    Act</a> should include  the same financial and other information relating to properties underlying  any loans which are significant as discussed in the last paragraph of Question  1, except that in the determination of significance the 20% disclosure threshold  should be measured using total assets. The staff believes that this presentation  would be consistent with <a href="../34ActRls/rule12b-20.html">Rule 12b-20</a> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<p><u>Question 3</u>: The interpretive response to question 1 indicates that  the staff believes that the borrower's equity in an operating property is adequate  to support accounting for the transaction as a mortgage loan when the borrower's  initial investment meets the criteria in paragraph 11 of Statement 66 and the  borrower's payments of principal and interest on the loan are adequate to maintain  a continuing investment in the property which meets the criteria in paragraph  12 of Statement 66. Is it the staff's view that meeting these criteria is the  only way the borrower's equity in the property is considered adequate to support  accounting for the transaction as a mortgage loan?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: No. It is the staff's position that the determination  of whether loan accounting is appropriate for these arrangements should be  made by the registrant and its independent accountants based on the facts and  circumstances of the individual arrangements, using the guidance provided in  the Exhibit I to the Appendix of the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants Practice Bulletin 1 (November, 1987) (&quot;Exhibit I to PB1&quot;).  As stated in Exhibit I to PB1, loan accounting may not be appropriate when  the lender participates in expected residual profit and has virtually the same  risks as those of an owner, or joint venturer. In assessing the question of  whether the lender has virtually the same risks as an owner, or joint venturer,  the essential test that needs to be addressed is whether the borrower has and  is expected to continue to have a substantial amount at risk in the project.<sup><a href="#P497_86371" name="P497_86372">16</a></sup> The  criteria described in Statement 66 provide a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for determining  whether the borrower has a substantial amount at risk in the form of a substantial  equity investment. The borrower may have a substantial amount at risk without  meeting the criteria described in Statement 66.<p><u>Question 4</u>: What financial statements should be included in filings  made under the Securities Act regarding investment-type arrangements that individually  amount to 10% or more of total assets?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: In the staff's view, separate audited financial  statements should be provided for any investment-type arrangement that constitutes  10% or more of the greater of (i) the amount of minimum proceeds or (ii) the  total assets of the registrant, including the amount of proceeds raised, as  of the date the filing is required to be made. Of course, the narrative information  required by items 14 and 15 of Form S-11 should also be included with respect  to these investment-type arrangements.<p><u>Question 5</u>: What information must be provided under the Securities  Act for investment-type arrangements that individually amount to less than  10%?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: No specific financial information need be presented  for investment-type arrangements that amount to less than 10%. However, where  such arrangements aggregate more than 20%, a narrative description of the general  character of the properties and arrangements should be included that gives  an investor an understanding of the risks and rewards associated with these  arrangements. Such information may, for example, include a description of the  terms of the arrangements, participation by the registrant in expected residual  profits, and property types and locations.<p><u>Question 6</u>: What financial statements should be included in annual  reports filed under the Exchange Act with respect to investment-type arrangements  that constitute 10% or more of the registrant's total assets?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: In annual reports filed with the Commission,  the staff has advised registrants that separate audited financial statements  should be provided for each nonconsolidated investment-type arrangement that  is 20% or more of the registrant's total assets. While the distribution is  on-going, however, the percentage may be calculated using the greater of (i)  the amount of the minimum proceeds or (ii) the total assets of the registrant,  including the amount of proceeds raised, as of the date the filing is required  to be made. In annual reports to shareholders registrants may either include  the separate audited financial statements for 20% or more nonconsolidated investment-type  arrangements or, if those financial statements are not included, present summarized  financial information for those arrangements in the notes to the registrant's  financial statements.<p>The staff has also indicated that separate summarized financial information  (as defined in Rule 1-02(bb) of Regulation S-X) should be provided in the footnotes  to the registrant's financial statements for each nonconsolidated investment-type  arrangement that is 10% or more but less than 20%. Of course, registrants should  also make appropriate textural disclosure with respect to material investment-type  arrangements in the &quot;business&quot; and &quot;property&quot; sections  of their annual reports to the Commission.<sup><a href="#P505_90195" name="P505_90196">17</a></sup><p><u>Question 7</u>: What information should be provided in annual reports filed  under the Exchange Act with respect to investment-type arrangements that do  not meet the 10% threshold?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: The staff believes it will not be necessary  to provide any financial information (full or summarized) for investment-type  arrangements that do not meet the 10% threshold. However, in the staff's view,  where such arrangements aggregate more than 20%, a narrative description of  the general character of the properties and arrangements would be necessary.  The staff believes that information should be included that would give an investor  an understanding of the risks and rewards associated with these arrangements.  Such information may, for example, include a description of the terms of the  arrangements, participation by the registrant in expected residual profits,  and property types and locations. Of course, disclosure regarding the operations  of such components should be included as part of the Management's Discussion  and Analysis where there is a known trend or uncertainty in the operations  of such properties, either individually or in the aggregate, which would be  reasonably likely to result in a material impact on the registrant's future  operations, liquidity or capital resources. <b><a name="1j"></a></b><p><b><a name="1.J"></a>J. Application Of Rule 3-05 In Initial Public Offerings</b><p><u>Facts</u>: <a href="../regS-X/SX3-05.html">Rule 3-05</a> of Regulation S-X establishes the financial statement  requirements for businesses acquired or to be acquired. If required, financial  statements must be provided for one, two or three years depending upon the  relative significance of the acquired entity as determined by the application  of <a href="../regS-X/SX1-02.html#w">Rule 1-02(w)</a> of Regulation S-X. The calculations required for these tests  are applied by comparison of the financial data of the registrant and acquiree(s)  for the fiscal years most recently completed prior to the acquisition. The  staff has recognized that these tests literally applied in some initial public  offerings may require financial statements for an acquired entity which may  not be significant to investors because the registrant has had substantial  growth in assets and earnings in recent years.<sup><a href="#P510_92628" name="P510_92629">18</a></sup><p><u>Question</u>: How should Rules 3-05 and 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X be applied  in determining the periods for which financial statements of acquirees are  required to be included in registration statements for initial public offerings?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: It is the staff's view that initial public offerings  involving businesses that have been built by the aggregation of discrete businesses  that remain substantially intact after acquisition<sup><a href="#P513_93437" name="P513_93438">19</a></sup> were  not contemplated during the drafting of Rule 3-05 and that the significance  of an acquired entity in such situations may be better measured in relation  to the size of the registrant at the time the registration statement is filed,  rather than its size at the time the acquisition was made. Therefore, for a  first time registrant, the staff has indicated that in applying the significance  tests in Rule 3-05, the three tests in Rule 1-02(w) generally can be measured  against the combined entities, including those to be acquired, which comprise  the registrant at the time the registration statement is filed. The staff's  policy is intended to ensure that the registration statement will include not  less than three, two and one year(s) of audited financial statements for not  less than 60%, 80% and 90%, respectively, of the constituent businesses that  will comprise the registrant on an ongoing basis. In all circumstances, the  audited financial statements of the registrant are required for three years,  or since its inception if less than three years. The requirement to provide  the audited financial statements of a constituent business in the registration  statement is satisfied for the post-acquisition period by including the entity's  results in the audited consolidated financial statements of the registrant.  If additional periods are required, the entity's separate audited financial  statements for the immediate pre-acquisition period(s) should be presented.<sup><a href="#P514_95565" name="P514_95566">20</a></sup><p>In order for the pre-acquisition audited financial statements of an acquiree  to be omitted from the registration statement, the following conditions must  be met:<ol type=a>  <p>  <li> the combined significance of businesses acquired or to be acquired for    which audited financial statements cover a period of less than 9 months<sup><a href="#P517_96170" name="P517_96171">21</a></sup> may    not exceed 10%;        <p>  <li> the combined significance of businesses acquired or to be acquired        for which audited financial statements cover a period of less than 21        months may not exceed 20%; and          <p>  <li> the combined significance of businesses acquired or to be acquired              for which audited financial statements cover a period of less than              33 months may not exceed 40%.</ol><p>Combined significance is the total, for all included companies, of each individual  company's highest level of significance computed under the three tests of significance.  The significance tests should be applied to pro forma financial statements  of the registrant, prepared in a manner consistent with <a href="../regS-X/art11.html">Article  11</a> of Regulation  S-X. The pro forma balance sheet should be as of the date of the registrant's  latest balance sheet included in the registration statement, and should give  effect to businesses acquired subsequent to the end of the latest year or to  be acquired as if they had been acquired on that date. The pro forma statement  of operations should be for the registrant's most recent fiscal year included  in the registration statement and should give effect to all acquisitions consummated  during and subsequent to the end of the year and probable acquisitions as if  they had been consummated at the beginning of that fiscal year.<p>The three tests specified in <a href="../regS-X/SX1-01.html#w">Rule 1-02(w)</a> should be made in comparison to  the registrant's pro forma consolidated assets and pretax income from continuing  operations. The assets and pretax income of the acquired businesses which are  being evaluated for significance should reflect any new cost basis arising  from purchase accounting.<p><u>Example</u>: On February 20, 20X9 Registrant files Form S-1 containing  its audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three years  ended December 31, 20X8.

Financial Statements Of Acquired Troubled Financial Institutions</b><p><u>Facts</u>: Federally insured depository institutions are subject to regulatory  oversight by various federal agencies including the Federal Reserve, Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and  Office of Thrift Supervision. During the 1980s, certain of these institutions  experienced significant financial difficulties resulting in their inability  to meet necessary capital and other regulatory requirements. The Financial  Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 was adopted to address  various issues affecting this industry.<p>Many troubled institutions have merged into stronger institutions or reduced  the scale of their operations through the sale of branches and other assets  pursuant to recommendation or directives of the regulatory agencies. In other  situations, institutions that were taken over by or operated under the management  of a federal regulator have been reorganized, sold or transferred by that federal  agency to financial and nonfinancial companies.<p>A number of registrants have acquired, or are contemplating acquisition of,  these troubled financial institutions. Complete audited financial statements  of the institutions for the periods necessary to comply fully with <a href="../regS-X/SX3-05.html">Rule  3-05</a>  of Regulation S-X may not be reasonably available in some cases. Some troubled  institutions have never obtained an audit while others have been operated under  receivership by regulators for a significant period without audit. Auditors'  reports on the financial statements of some of these acquirees may not satisfy  the requirements of <a href="../regS-X/SX2-02.html">Rule 2-02</a> of Regulation S-X because they contain qualifications  due to audit scope limitations or disclaim an opinion.<p>A registrant that acquires a troubled financial institution for which complete  audited financial statements are not reasonably available may be precluded  from raising capital through a public offering of securities for up to three  years following the acquisition because of the inability to comply with Rule  3-05.<p><u>Question 1</u>: Are there circumstances under which the staff would conclude  that financial statements of an acquired troubled financial institution are  not required by Rule 3-05?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Yes. In some case, financial statements will  not be required because there is not sufficient continuity of the acquired  entity's operations prior to and after the acquisition, so that disclosure  of prior financial information is material to an understanding of future operations,  as discussed in <a href="../regS-X/SX11-01.html">Rule 11-01</a> of Regulation S-X. For example, such a circumstance  may exist in the case of an acquisition solely of the physical facilities of  a banking branch with assumption of the related deposits if neither income-producing  assets (other than treasury bills and similar low-risk investment) nor the  management responsible for its historical investment and lending activities  transfer with the branch to the registrant. In this and other circumstances,  where the registrant can persuasively demonstrate that continuity of operations  is substantially lacking and a representation to this effect is included in  the filing, the staff will not object to the omission of financial statements.  However, applicable disclosures specified by Industry Guide 3, <a href="../regS-X/art11.html">Article  11</a> of  Regulation S-X (pro forma information), and other information which is descriptive  of the transaction and of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed should  be furnished to the extent reasonably available.<p><u>Question 2</u>: If the acquired financial institution is found to constitute  a business having material continuity of operations after the transaction,  are there circumstances in which the staff will waive the requirements of Rule  3-05?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Yes. The staff believes the circumstances surrounding  the present restructuring of U.S. depository institutions are unique. Accordingly,  the staff has identified situations in which it will grant a waiver of the  requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X to the extent that audited financial  statements are not reasonably available.<p>For purposes of this waiver a &quot;troubled financial institution&quot; is  one which either:<ol>  <p>  <li> Is in receivership, conservatorship or is otherwise operating under a    similar supervisory agreement with a federal financial regulatory agency;    or      <p>  <li> Is controlled by a federal regulatory agency; or        <p>  <li> Is acquired in a federally assisted transaction.</ol><p>A registrant that acquires a troubled financial institution that is deemed  significant pursuant to Rule 3-05 may omit audited financial statements of  the acquired entity, if such statements are not reasonably available and the  total acquired assets of the troubled institution do not exceed 20% of the  registrant's assets before giving effect to the acquisition. The staff will  consider requests for waivers in situations involving more significant acquisitions,  where federal financial assistance or guarantees are an essential part of the  transaction, or where the nature and magnitude of federal assistance is so  pervasive as to substantially reduce the relevance of such information to an  assessment of future operations. Where financial statements are waived, disclosure  concerning the acquired business as outlined in response to Question 3 must  be furnished.<p><u>Question 3</u>: Where historical financial statements meeting the requirements  of <a href="../regS-X/SX3-05.html">Rule 3-05</a> of Regulation S-X are waived, what financial statements and other  disclosures would the staff expect to be provided in filings with the Commission?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: Where complete audited historical financial  statements of a significant acquiree that is a troubled financial institution  are not provided, the staff would expect filings to include an audited statement  of assets acquired and liabilities assumed if the acquisition is not already  reflected in the registrant's most recent audited balance sheet at the time  the filing is made. Where reasonably available, unaudited statement of operations  and cash flows that are prepared in accordance with GAAP and otherwise comply  with Regulation S-X should be filed in lieu of any audited financial statements  which are not provided if historical information may be relevant.<p>In all cases where a registrant succeeds to assets and/or liabilities of a  troubled financial institution which are significant to the registrant pursuant  to the tests in <a href="../regS-X/SX1-02.html#w">Rule 1-02(w)</a> of Regulation S-X, narrative description should  be required, quantified to the extent practicable, of the anticipated effects  of the acquisition on the registrant's financial condition, liquidity, capital  resources and operating results. If federal financial assistance (including  any commitments, agreements or understandings made with respect to capital,  accounting or other forbearances) may be material, the limits, conditions and  other variables affecting its availability should be disclosed, along with  an analysis of its likely short term and long term effects on cash flows and  reported results.<p>If the transaction will result in the recognition of any significant intangibles  that cannot be separately sold, such as goodwill or a core deposit intangible,  the discussion of the transaction should describe the amount of such intangibles,  the necessarily subjective nature of the estimation of the life and value of  such intangibles, and the effects upon future results of operations, liquidity  and capital resources, including any consequences if a recognized intangible  will be excluded from the calculation of capital for regulatory purposes. The  discussion of the impact on future operations should specifically address the  period over which intangibles will be amortized and the period over which any  discounts on acquired assets will be taken into income. If amortization of  intangibles will be over a period which differs from the period over which  income from discounts on acquired assets will be recognized (whether from amortization  of discounts or sale of discounted assets), disclosure should be provided concerning  the disparate effects of the amortization and income recognition on operating  results for all affected periods.<p>Information specified by Industry Guide 3 should be furnished to the extent  applicable and reasonably available. For the categories identified in the Industry  Guide, the registrant should disclose the carrying value of loans and investments  acquired, as well as their principal amount and average contractual yield and  term. Amounts of acquired investments, loans, or other assets that are nonaccrual,  past due or restructured, or for which other collectibility problems are indicated  should be disclosed. Where historical financial statements of the acquired  entity are furnished, pro forma information presented pursuant to <a href="../regS-X/SX11-02.html">Rule  11-02</a>  should be supplemented as necessary with a discussion of the likely effects  of any federal assistance and changes in operations subsequent to the acquisition.  To the extent historical financial statements meeting all the requirements  of <a href="../regS-X/SX3-05.html">Rule 3-05</a> are not furnished, the filing should include an explanation of  the basis for their omission.<p><u>Question 4</u>: If an audited statement of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed is required, but certain of the assets conveyed in the transaction  are subject to rights allowing the registrant to put the assets back to the  seller upon completion of a due diligence review, will the staff grant an extension  of time for filing the required financial statement until the put period lapses?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: If it is impracticable to provide an audited  statement at the time the Form 8-K reporting the transaction is filed, an extension  of time is available under certain circumstances. Specifically, if more than  25% of the acquired assets may be put and the put period does not exceed 120  days, the registrant should timely file a statement of assets acquired and  liabilities assumed on an unaudited basis with full disclosure of the terms  and amounts of the put arrangement. Within 21 days after the put period lapses,  the registrant should furnish an audited statement of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed unless the effects of the transaction are already reflected in an audited  balance sheet which has been filed with the Commission. However, until the  audited financial statement has been filed, certain offerings under the Securities  Act of 1933 would be prevented, as described in Instruction 1 to Item 7 of  Form 8-K.<p><b>L.

Materiality</b><p><a name="1.M.1"></a><b>1.<u> Assessing materiality</u></b><p><u>Facts</u>: During the course of preparing or auditing year-end financial  statements, financial management or the registrant's independent auditor becomes  aware of misstatements in a registrant's financial statements. When combined,  the misstatements result in a 4% overstatement of net income and a $.02 (4%)  overstatement of earnings per share. Because no item in the registrant's consolidated  financial statements is misstated by more than 5%, management and the independent  auditor conclude that the deviation from GAAP is immaterial and that the accounting  is permissible.<sup><a href="#P689_111592" name="P689_111593">24</a></sup><p><u>Question</u>: Each Statement of Financial Accounting Standards adopted  by the FASB states, &quot;The provisions of this Statement need not be applied  to immaterial items.&quot; In the staff's view, may a registrant or the auditor  of its financial statements assume the immateriality of items that fall below  a percentage threshold set by management or the auditor to determine whether  amounts and items are material to the financial statements?<p><u>Interpretive Response</u>: No. The staff is aware that certain registrants,  over time, have developed quantitative thresholds as &quot;rules of thumb&quot; to  assist in the preparation of their financial statements, and that auditors  also have used these thresholds in their evaluation of whether items might  be considered material to users of a registrant's financial statements. One  rule of thumb in particular suggests that the misstatement or omission<sup><a href="#P692_113330" name="P692_113331">25</a></sup> of  an item that falls under a 5% threshold is not material in the absence of particularly  egregious circumstances, such as self-dealing or misappropriation by senior  management. The staff reminds registrants and the auditors of their financial  statements that exclusive reliance on this or any percentage or numerical threshold  has no basis in the accounting literature or the law.<p>The use of a percentage as a numerical threshold, such as 5%, may provide  the basis for a preliminary assumption that - without considering all relevant  circumstances - a deviation of less than the specified percentage with respect  to a particular item on the registrant's financial statements is unlikely to  be material. The staff has no objection to such a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; as  an initial step in assessing materiality. But quantifying, in percentage terms,  the magnitude of a misstatement is only the beginning of an analysis of materiality;  it cannot appropriately be used as a substitute for a full analysis of all  relevant considerations. Materiality concerns the significance of an item to  users of a registrant's financial statements. A matter is &quot;material&quot; if  there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it  important. In its Concepts Statement 2, the FASB stated the essence of the  concept of materiality as follows:<blockquote>  <p>The omission or misstatement of an item in a financial report is material    if, in the light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item    is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying    upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or    correction of the item.<sup><a href="#P695_115129" name="P695_115130">26</a></sup> </blockquote><p>This formulation in the accounting literature is in substance identical to  the formulation used by the courts in interpreting the federal securities laws.  The Supreme Court has held that a fact is material if there is -<blockquote>  <p>a substantial likelihood that the...fact would have been viewed by the reasonable    investor as having significantly altered the &quot;total mix&quot; of information    made available.<sup><a href="#P698_115622" name="P698_115623">27</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Under the governing principles, an assessment of materiality requires that  one views the facts in the context of the &quot;surrounding circumstances,&quot; as  the accounting literature puts it, or the &quot;total mix&quot; of information,  in the words of the Supreme Court. In the context of a misstatement of a financial  statement item, while the &quot;total mix&quot; includes the size in numerical  or percentage terms of the misstatement, it also includes the factual context  in which the user of financial statements would view the financial statement  item. The shorthand in the accounting and auditing literature for this analysis  is that financial management and the auditor must consider both &quot;quantitative&quot; and &quot;qualitative&quot; factors  in assessing an item's materiality.<sup><a href="#P700_116749" name="P700_116750">28</a></sup> Court  decisions, Commission rules and enforcement actions, and accounting and auditing  literature<sup><a href="#P701_117496" name="P701_117497">29</a></sup> have  all considered &quot;qualitative&quot; factors in various contexts.<p>The FASB has long emphasized that materiality cannot be reduced to a numerical  formula. In its Concepts Statement 2, the FASB noted that some had urged it  to promulgate quantitative materiality guides for use in a variety of situations.  The FASB rejected such an approach as representing only a &quot;minority view,  stating -<blockquote>  <p>The predominant view is that materiality judgments can properly be made    only by those who have all the facts. The Board's present position is that    no general standards of materiality could be formulated to take into account    all the considerations that enter into an experienced human judgment.<sup><a href="#P704_118895" name="P704_118896">30</a></sup> </blockquote><p>The FASB noted that, in certain limited circumstances, the Commission and  other authoritative bodies had issued quantitative materiality guidance, citing  as examples guidelines ranging from one to ten percent with respect to a variety  of disclosures.<sup><a href="#P706_119184" name="P706_119185">31</a></sup> And  it took account of contradictory studies, one showing a lack of uniformity  among auditors on materiality judgments, and another suggesting widespread  use of a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; of five to ten percent of net income.<sup><a href="#P707_119450" name="P707_119451">32</a></sup> The  FASB also considered whether an evaluation of materiality could be based solely  on anticipating the market's reaction to accounting information.<sup><a href="#P708_119639" name="P708_119640">33</a></sup><p>The FASB rejected a formulaic approach to discharging &quot;the onerous duty  of making materiality decisions&quot;<sup><a href="#P710_119787" name="P710_119788">34</a></sup> in  favor of an approach that takes into account all the relevant considerations.  In so doing, it made clear that -<blockquote>  <p>[M]agnitude by itself, without regard to the nature of the item and the    circumstances in which the judgment has to be made, will not generally be    a sufficient basis for a materiality judgment.<sup><a href="#P712_120134" name="P712_120135">35</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Evaluation of materiality requires a registrant and its auditor to consider <i>all</i> the  relevant circumstances, and the staff believes that there are numerous circumstances  in which misstatements below 5% could well be material. Qualitative factors  may cause misstatements of quantitatively small amounts to be material; as  stated in the auditing literature:<blockquote>  <p>As a result of the interaction of quantitative and qualitative considerations    in materiality judgments, misstatements of relatively small amounts that    come to the auditor's attention could have a material effect on the financial    statements.<sup><a href="#P715_120768" name="P715_120769">36</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Among the considerations that may well render material a quantitatively small  misstatement of a financial statement item are -<ul>  <p>  <li> whether the misstatement arises from an item capable of precise measurement    or whether it arises from an estimate and, if so, the degree of imprecision    inherent in the estimate<sup><a href="#P718_121084" name="P718_121085">37</a></sup> <p>  <li> whether the misstatement masks a change in earnings or other trends<p>  <li> whether the misstatement hides a failure to meet analysts' consensus expectations for the enterprise<p>  <li> whether the misstatement changes a loss into income or vice versa<p> <li>whether the misstatement concerns a segment or other portion of the registrant's  business that has been identified as playing a significant role in the registrant's   operations or profitability <p><li>whether the misstatement affects the registrant's compliance with regulatory requirements <p><li>whether the misstatement affects the registrant's compliance with loan covenants or other contractual requirements <p><li>whether the misstatement has the effect of increasing management's compensation - for example, by satisfying requirements for the award of bonuses  or other forms of incentive compensation <p><li>whether the misstatement involves concealment of an unlawful transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 transaction.</ul><p>This is not an exhaustive list of the circumstances that may affect the materiality  of a quantitatively small misstatement.<sup><a href="#P728_122849" name="P728_122850">38</a></sup> Among  other factors, the demonstrated volatility of the price of a registrant's securities  in response to certain types of disclosures may provide guidance as to whether  investors regard quantitatively small misstatements as material. Consideration  of potential market reaction to disclosure of a misstatement is by itself &quot;too  blunt an instrument to be depended on&quot; in considering whether a fact is  material.<sup><a href="#P729_123719" name="P729_123720">39</a></sup> When,  however, management or the independent auditor expects (based, for example,  on a pattern of market performance) that a known misstatement may result in  a significant positive or negative market reaction, that expected reaction  should be taken into account when considering whether a misstatement is material.<sup><a href="#P730_124078" name="P730_124079">40</a></sup><p>For the reasons noted above, the staff believes that a registrant and the  auditors of its financial statements should not assume that even small intentional  misstatements in financial statements, for example those pursuant to actions  to &quot;manage&quot; earnings, are immaterial.<sup><a href="#P732_124515" name="P732_124516">41</a></sup> While  the intent of management does not render a misstatement material, it may provide  significant evidence of materiality. The evidence may be particularly compelling  where management has intentionally misstated items in the financial statements  to &quot;manage&quot; reported earnings. In that instance, it presumably has  done so believing that the resulting amounts and trends would be significant  to users of the registrant's financial statements.<sup><a href="#P733_125211" name="P733_125212">42</a></sup> The  staff believes that investors generally would regard as significant a management  practice to over- or under-state earnings up to an amount just short of a percentage  threshold in order to &quot;manage&quot; earnings. Investors presumably also  would regard as significant an accounting practice that, in essence, rendered  all earnings figures subject to a management-directed margin of misstatement.<p>The materiality of a misstatement may turn on where it appears in the financial  statements. For example, a misstatement may involve a segment of the registrant's  operations. In that instance, in assessing materiality of a misstatement to  the financial statements taken as a whole, registrants and their auditors should  consider not only the size of the misstatement but also the significance of  the segment information to the financial statements taken as a whole.<sup><a href="#P735_126295" name="P735_126296">43</a></sup> &quot;A  misstatement of the revenue and operating profit of a relatively small segment  that is represented by management to be important to the future profitability  of the entity&quot;<sup><a href="#P736_126546" name="P736_126547">44</a></sup> is  more likely to be material to investors than a misstatement in a segment that  management has not identified as especially important. In assessing the materiality  of misstatements in segment information - as with materiality generally -<blockquote>  <p>situations may arise in practice where the auditor will conclude that a    matter relating to segment information is qualitatively material even though,    in his or her judgment, it is quantitatively immaterial to the financial    statements taken as a whole.<sup><a href="#P738_127051" name="P738_127052">45</a></sup> </blockquote><p><u>Aggregating and Netting Misstatements</u><p>In determining whether multiple misstatements cause the financial statements  to be materially misstated, registrants and the auditors of their financial  statements should consider each misstatement separately and the aggregate effect  of all misstatements.<sup><a href="#P741_127349" name="P741_127350">46</a></sup> A  registrant and its auditor should evaluate misstatements in light of quantitative  and qualitative factors and &quot;consider whether, in relation to individual  amounts, subtotals, or totals in the financial statements, they materially  misstate the financial statements taken as a whole.&quot;<sup><a href="#P742_127926" name="P742_127927">47</a></sup> This  requires consideration of -<blockquote>  <p>the significance of an item to a particular entity (for example, inventories    to a manufacturing company), the pervasiveness of the misstatement (such    as whether it affects the presentation of numerous financial statement items),    and the effect of the misstatement on the financial statements taken as a    whole....<sup><a href="#P744_128958" name="P744_128959">48</a></sup> </blockquote><p>Registrants and their auditors first should consider whether each misstatement  is material, irrespective of its effect when combined with other misstatements.  The literature notes that the analysis should consider whether the misstatement  of &quot;individual amounts&quot; causes a material misstatement of the financial  statements taken as a whole. As with materiality generally, this analysis requires  consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.<p>If the misstatement of an individual amount causes the financial statements  as a whole to be materially misstated, that effect cannot be eliminated by  other misstatements whose effect may be to diminish the impact of the misstatement  on other financial statement items. To take an obvious example, if a registrant's  revenues are a material financial statement item and if they are materially  overstated, the financial statements taken as a whole will be materially misleading  even if the effect on earnings is completely offset by an equivalent overstatement  of expenses.<p>Even though a misstatement of an individual amount may not cause the financial  statements taken as a whole to be materially misstated, it may nonetheless,  when aggregated with other misstatements, render the financial statements taken  as a whole to be materially misleading. Registrants and the auditors of their  financial statements accordingly should consider the effect of the misstatement  on subtotals or totals. The auditor should aggregate all misstatements that  affect each subtotal or total and consider whether the misstatements in the  aggregate affect the subtotal or total in a way that causes the registrant's  financial statements taken as a whole to be materially misleading.<sup><a href="#P748_130687" name="P748_130688">49</a></sup><p>The staff believes that, in considering the aggregate effect of multiple misstatements  on a subtotal or total, registrants and the auditors of their financial statements  should exercise particular care when considering whether to offset (or the  appropriateness of offsetting) a misstatement of an estimated amount with a  misstatement of an item capable of precise measurement. As noted above, assessments  of materiality should never be purely mechanical; given the imprecision inherent  in estimates, there is by definition a corresponding imprecision in the aggregation  of misstatements involving estimates with those that do not involve an estimate.<p>Registrants and auditors also should consider the effect of misstatements  from prior periods on the current financial statements. For example, the auditing  literature states,<blockquote>  <p>Matters underlying adjustments proposed by the auditor but not recorded    by the entity could potentially cause future financial statements to be materially    misstated, even though the auditor has concluded that the adjustments are    not material to the current financial statements.<sup><a href="#P752_131804" name="P752_131805">50</a></sup> </blockquote><p>This may be particularly the case where immaterial misstatements recur in  several years and the cumulative effect becomes material in the current year.<p><a name="1m2"></a><b>2.<u> Immaterial misstatements that are intentional</u></b><p><u>Facts</u>: A registrant's management intentionally has made adjustments  to various financial statement items in a manner inconsistent with GAAP.

Williams.<sup><a href="#P768_136497" name="P768_136498">58</a></sup> In  his address, Chairman Williams noted that, like materiality, &quot;reasonableness&quot; is  not an &quot;absolute standard of exactitude for corporate records.&quot;<sup><a href="#P769_136852" name="P769_136853">59</a></sup> Unlike  materiality, however, &quot;reasonableness&quot; is not solely a measure of  the significance of a financial statement item to investors. &quot;Reasonableness,&quot; in  this context, reflects a judgment as to whether an issuer's failure to correct  a known misstatement implicates the purposes underlying the accounting provisions  of Sections 13(b)(2) - (7) of the Exchange Act.<sup><a href="#P770_137240" name="P770_137241">60</a></sup><p>In assessing whether a misstatement results in a violation of a registrant's  obligation to keep books and records that are accurate &quot;in reasonable  detail,&quot; registrants and their auditors should consider, in addition to  the factors discussed above concerning an evaluation of a misstatement's potential  materiality, the factors set forth below.<ul>  <p>  <li> The significance of the misstatement. Though the staff does not believe    that registrants need to make finely calibrated determinations of significance    with respect to immaterial items, plainly it is &quot;reasonable&quot; to    treat misstatements whose effects are clearly inconsequential differently    than more significant ones.        <p>  <li> How the misstatement arose. It is unlikely that it is ever &quot;reasonable&quot; for        registrants to record misstatements or not to correct known misstatements        - even immaterial ones - as part of an ongoing effort directed by or        known to senior management for the purposes of &quot;managing&quot; earnings.        On the other hand, insignificant misstatements that arise from the operation        of systems or recurring processes in the normal course of business generally        will not cause a registrant's books to be inaccurate &quot;in reasonable        detail.&quot;<sup><a href="#P774_138427" name="P774_138428">61</a></sup>        <p>  <li> The cost of correcting the misstatement. The books and records            provisions of the Exchange Act do not require registrants to make            major expenditures to correct small misstatements.<sup><a href="#P776_139627" name="P776_139628">62</a></sup> Conversely,            where there is little cost or delay involved in correcting a misstatement,            failing to do so is unlikely to be &quot;reasonable.&quot;        <p>  <li> The clarity of authoritative accounting guidance with respect                to the misstatement. Where reasonable minds may differ about                the appropriate accounting treatment of a financial statement                item, a failure to correct it may not render the registrant's                financial statements inaccurate &quot;in reasonable detail.&quot; Where,                however, there is little ground for reasonable disagreement,                the case for leaving a misstatement uncorrected is correspondingly                weaker.</ul><p>There may be other indicators of &quot;reasonableness&quot; that registrants  and their auditors may ordinarily consider. Because the judgment is not mechanical,  the staff will be inclined to continue to defer to judgments that &quot;allow  a business, acting in good faith, to comply with the Act's accounting provisions  in an innovative and cost-effective way.&quot;<sup><a href="#P779_140739" name="P779_140740">63</a></sup><p><u>The Auditor's Response to Intentional Misstatements</u><p><a href="../34Act/sec10A.html#b">Section 10A(b)</a> of the Exchange Act requires auditors to take certain actions  upon discovery of an &quot;illegal act.&quot;<sup><a href="#P782_140919" name="P782_140920">64</a></sup> The  statute specifies that these obligations are triggered &quot;whether or not  [the illegal acts are] perceived to have a material effect on the financial  statements of the issuer....&quot; Among other things, <a href="../34Act/sec10A.html#b.1">Section  10A(b)(1)</a> requires  the auditor to inform the appropriate level of management of an illegal act  (unless clearly inconsequential) and assure that the registrant's audit committee  is &quot;adequately informed&quot; with respect to the illegal act.<p>As noted, an intentional misstatement of immaterial items in a registrant's  financial statements may violate <a href="../34Act/sec13.html#b.2">Section 13(b)(2)</a> of the Exchange Act and thus  be an illegal act. When such a violation occurs, an auditor must take steps  to see that the registrant's audit committee is &quot;adequately informed&quot; about  the illegal act. Because Section 10A(b)(1) is triggered regardless of whether  an illegal act has a material effect on the registrant's financial statements,  where the illegal act consists of a misstatement in the registrant's financial  statements, the auditor will be required to report that illegal act to the  audit committee irrespective of any &quot;netting&quot; of the misstatements  with other financial statement items.<p>The requirements of <a href="../34Act/sec10A.html">Section 10A</a> echo the auditing literature. See, for example,  SAS Nos. 54 and 99. Pursuant to paragraph 77 of SAS 99, if the auditor determines  there is evidence that fraud may exist, the auditor must discuss the matter  with the appropriate level of management that is at least one level above those  involved, and with senior management and the audit committee. The auditor must  report directly to the audit committee fraud involving senior management and  fraud that causes a material misstatement of the financial statements. Paragraph  6 of SAS 99 states that &quot;misstatements arising from fraudulent financial  reporting are intentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or disclosures  in financial statements designed to deceive financial statement users . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#P785_143256" name="P785_143257">65</a></sup> SAS  99 further states that fraudulent financial reporting may involve falsification  or alteration of accounting records; misrepresenting or omitting events, transactions  or other information in the financial statements; and the intentional misapplication  of accounting principles relating to amounts, classifications, the manner of  presentation, or disclosures in the financial statements.<sup><a href="#P786_144141" name="P786_144142">66</a></sup> The  clear implication of SAS 99 is that immaterial misstatements may be fraudulent  financial reporting.<sup><a href="#P787_145087" name="P787_145088">67</a></sup><p>Auditors that learn of intentional misstatements may also be required to (1)  re-evaluate the degree of audit risk involved in the audit engagement, (2)  determine whether to revise the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures  accordingly, and (3) consider whether to resign.<sup><a href="#P789_146120" name="P789_146121">68</a></sup><p>Intentional misstatements also may signal the existence of reportable conditions  or material weaknesses in the registrant's system of internal accounting control  designed to detect and deter improper accounting and financial reporting.<sup><a href="#P791_146494" name="P791_146495">69</a></sup> As  stated by the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, also known  as the Treadway Commission, in its 1987 report,<blockquote>  <p>The tone set by top management -- the corporate environment or culture within    which financial reporting occurs - is the most important factor contributing    to the integrity of the financial reporting process. Notwithstanding an impressive    set of written rules and procedures, if the tone set by management is lax,    fraudulent financial reporting is more likely to occur.<sup><a href="#P793_147016" name="P793_147017">70</a></sup> </blockquote><p>An auditor is required to report to a registrant's audit committee any reportable  conditions or material weaknesses in a registrant's system of internal accounting  control that the auditor discovers in the course of the examination of the  registrant's financial statements.<sup><a href="#P795_147528" name="P795_147529">71</a></sup><p><u>GAAP precedence over industry practice</u><p>Some have argued to the staff that registrants should be permitted to follow  an industry accounting practice even though that practice is inconsistent with  authoritative accounting literature. This situation might occur if a practice  is developed when there are few transactions and the accounting results are  clearly inconsequential, and that practice never changes despite a subsequent  growth in the number or materiality of such transactions. The staff disagrees  with this argument. Authoritative literature takes precedence over industry  practice that is contrary to GAAP.<sup><a href="#P798_148649" name="P798_148650">72</a></sup><p><u>General comments</u><p>This SAB is not intended to change current law or guidance in the accounting  or auditing literature.<sup><a href="#P801_148782" name="P801_148783">73</a></sup> This  SAB and the authoritative accounting literature cannot specifically address  all of the novel and complex business transactions and events that may occur.  Accordingly, registrants may account for, and make disclosures about, these  transactions and events based on analogies to similar situations or other factors.  The staff may not, however, always be persuaded that a registrant's determination  is the most appropriate under the circumstances. When disagreements occur after  a transaction or an event has been reported, the consequences may be severe  for registrants, auditors, and, most importantly, the users of financial statements  who have a right to expect consistent accounting and reporting for, and disclosure  of, similar transactions and events. The staff, therefore, encourages registrants  and auditors to discuss on a timely basis with the staff proposed accounting  treatments for, or disclosures about, transactions or events that are not specifically  covered by the existing accounting literature.<pre></pre><p><table border=0 width="90%" align="center" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=8 class="main">  <tr>    <td colspan=2><strong>Endnotes:</strong>    </td>  </tr>  <tr valign=top>    <td><a  name="P407_54436" href="#P407_54437">1.</a></td>    <td> Paragraph 40 of Statement 109 states: &quot;The consolidated amount      of current and deferred tax expense for a group that files a consolidated      tax return shall be allocated among the members of the group when those      members issue separate financial statements. . . .

Because this SAB does not change current      law or guidance in the accounting or auditing literature, adherence to      the principles described in this SAB should not raise the costs associated      with recordkeeping or with audits of financial statements. </td>  </tr></table><!--End of Index--><hr><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Publication History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>December 2003 Codification<br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="index.html">Previous</a><a href=".index.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="topic2.html">Next</a> </td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
