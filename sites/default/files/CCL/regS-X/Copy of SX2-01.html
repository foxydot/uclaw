Accordingly, the rule sets forth restrictions on financial,     employment, and business relationships between an accountant and an audit     client and restrictions on an accountant providing certain non-audit services     to an audit client.<br>    <br>  <LI type="1"><A NAME="prelimnote.2"></A>Section 210.2-01(b) sets forth the general     standard of auditor independence. Paragraphs (c)(1) to (c)(5) reflect the     application of the general standard to particular circumstances. The rule     does not purport to, and the Commission could not, consider all circumstances     that raise independence concerns, and these are subject to the general standard     in Rule 2-01(b). In considering this standard, the Commission looks in the     first instance to whether a relationship or the provision of a service: creates     a mutual or conflicting interest between the accountant and the audit client;     places the accountant in the position of auditing his or her own work; results     in the accountant acting as management or an employee of the audit client;     or places the accountant in a position of being an advocate for the audit     client.<br>    <br>  <LI type="1"><A NAME="prelimnote.3"></A>These factors are general guidance only     and their application may depend on particular facts and circumstances. For     that reason, Rule 2-01 provides that, in determining whether an accountant     is independent, the Commission will consider all relevant facts and circumstances.     For the same reason, registrants and accountants are encouraged to consult     with the Commission's Office of the Chief Accountant before entering into     relationships, including relationships involving the provision of services,     that are not explicitly described in the rule.</OL><HR><br><br><OL Type="a"><LI type="a"><A NAME="a"></A>The Commission will not recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is not duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office.
