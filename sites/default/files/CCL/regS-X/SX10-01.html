Interim financial statements   shall follow the general form and content of presentation prescribed by the   other sections of this Regulation with the following exceptions: <br>  <br>  <OL>    <br>    <A NAME="a1"></A>(1) Interim financial statements required by this rule need     only be provided as to the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated and     may be unaudited. Separate statements of other entities which may otherwise     be required by this regulation may be omitted. <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="a2"></A>(2) Interim balance sheets shall include only major captions     (i.e., numbered captions) prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation     with the exception of inventories. Data as to raw materials, work in process     and finished goods inventories shall be included either on the face of the     balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements, if applicable.     Where any major balance sheet caption is less than 10% of total assets, and     the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 25%     since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with     others. <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="a3"></A>(3) Interim statements of income shall also include major     captions prescribed by the applicable sections of this Regulation. When any     major income statement caption is less than 15% of average net income for     the most recent three fiscal years and the amount in the caption has not increased     or decreased by more than 20% as compared to the corresponding interim period     of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In     calculating average net income, loss years should be excluded. If losses were     incurred in each of the most recent three years, the average loss shall be     used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, <a href="SX4-02.html">Rule     4-02</A> applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be shown separately,     except that registrants reporting under <a href="art9.html">Article 9</A>     shall show investment securities gains or losses separately regardless of     size. <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="a4"></A>(4) The statement of cash flows may be abbreviated starting     with a single figure of net cash flows from operating activities and showing     cash changes from investing and financing activities individually only when     they exceed 10% of the average of net cash flows from operating activities     for the most recent three years. Notwithstanding this test, <a href="SX4-02.html">Rule     4-02</A> applies and de minimis amounts therefore need not be shown separately.     <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="a5"></A>(5) The interim financial information shall include disclosures     either on the face of the financial statements or in accompanying footnotes     sufficient so as to make the interim information presented not misleading.     Registrants may presume that users of the interim financial information have     read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding     fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair     presentation, except in regard to material contingencies may be determined     in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure which would substantially     duplicate the disclosure contained in the most recent annual report to security     holders or latest audited financial statements, such as a statement of significant     accounting policies and practices, details of accounts which have not changed     significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently     completed fiscal year, and detailed disclosures prescribed by <a href="SX4-08.html">Rule     4-08</A> of this Regulation, may be omitted. However, disclosure shall be     provided where events subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year     have occurred which have a material impact on the registrant. Disclosures     should encompass for example, significant changes since the end of the most     recently completed fiscal year in such items as: accounting principles and     practices; estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements;     status of long-term contracts; capitalization including significant new borrowings     or modification of existing financing arrangements; and the reporting entity     resulting from business combinations or dispositions. Notwithstanding the     above, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall     be provided even though a significant change since year end may not have occurred.     <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="a6"></A>(6) Detailed schedules otherwise required by this Regulation     may be omitted for purposes of preparing interim financial statements. <br>    <br>    <br><A NAME="a7"></A>(7) In addition to the financial statements required by paragraphs (a)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, registrants in the development stage shall provide the cumulative financial statements (condensed to the same degree as allowed in this paragraph) and disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7, &quot;Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises&quot; to the date of the latest balance sheet presented. </OL>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="b"></A>(b) <B>Other instructions as to content</B>. The following additional   instructions shall be applicable for purposes of preparing interim financial   statements: <br>  <br>  <OL>    <br>    (1) Summarized income statement information shall be given separately as to     each subsidiary not consolidated or 50 percent or less owned persons or as     to each group of such subsidiaries or fifty percent or less owned persons     for which separate individual or group statements would otherwise be required     for annual periods. Such summarized information, however, need not be furnished     for any such unconsolidated subsidiary or person which would not be required     pursuant to Rule <a href="../34ActRls/rule13a-13.html">13a-13</A> or <a href="../34ActRls/rule15d-13.html">15d-13</a>     to file quarterly financial information with the Commission if it were a registrant.     <br>    <br>    <br>(2) If appropriate, the income statement shall show earnings per share and dividends declared per share applicable to common stock. The basis of the earnings per share computation shall be stated together with the number of shares used in the computation. In addition, see <a href="../regS-K/SK601.html#b.11">Item 601(b)(11)</A> of Regulation S-K. <br>    <br>    <br>    (3) If, during the most recent interim period presented, the registrant or any of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a combination between 	entities under common control, the interim financial statements for both the current year and the preceding year shall reflect the combined results 	of the combined businesses. Supplemental disclosure of the separate results of the combined entities for periods prior to the combination shall be given, 	with appropriate explanations.<br>    <br>    <br>    (4) Where a material business combination has occurred during the current fiscal year, pro forma disclosure shall be made of the results of 	operations for the current year up to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided (and for the corresponding period in the preceding year)	 as though the companies had combined at the beginning of the period being reported on. This pro forma information shall, at a minimum, show revenue, 	 income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, including such income on a per share basis, net income, net income 	 attributable to the registrant, and net income per share.<br>    <br>    <br>    (5) Where the registrant has disposed of any significant segment of its business     (as defined in paragraph 13 of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30)     during any of the periods covered by the interim financial statements, the     effect thereof on revenues and net income-total and per share for all periods     shall be disclosed. <br>    <br>    <br>    (6)In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing standards for accounting changes, the registrant shall state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it. In addition, for filings on <a href="../34forms/form10-Q.html">Form 10-Q</a>, a letter from the registrant's independent accountant shall be filed as an exhibit (in accordance with the provisions of <a href="../regS-K/SK601.html">Item 601</a> of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.601) in the first Form 10-Q after the date of an accounting change indicating whether or not the change is to an alternative principle which, in the accountant's judgment, is preferable under the circumstances; except that no letter from the accountant need be filed when the change is made in response to a standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that requires such change.. <br>    <br>    <br>    (7) Any material retroactive prior period adjustment made during any period     covered by the interim financial statements shall be disclosed, together with     the effect thereof upon net income- total and per share- of any prior period     included and upon the balance of retained earnings. If results of operations     for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item     subsequent to the initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of     the effect of the change shall be made. <br>    <br>    <br>    (8) Any unaudited interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all     adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement     of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect     shall be included. Such adjustments shall include, for example, appropriate     estimated provisions for bonus and profit sharing arrangements normally determined     or settled at year-end. If all such adjustments are of a normal recurring     nature, a statement to that effect shall be made; otherwise, there shall be     furnished information describing in appropriate detail the nature and amount     of any adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments entering into the     determination of the results shown.   </OL>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="c"></A>(c) <B>Periods to be covered</B>. The periods for which interim financial statements are to be provided in registration statements are prescribed elsewhere in this Regulation (see <a href="SX3-01.html">Rules 210.3-01</a> and <a href="SX3-02.html">3-02</a>). For filings on Form 10-Q, financial statements shall be provided as set forth in this paragraph (c):<br>  <br>  <OL>    <br>    <A NAME="c1"></A>(1) An interim balance sheet as of the end of the most recent     fiscal quarter and a balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal year     shall be provided. The balance sheet as of the end of the preceding fiscal     year may be condensed to the same degree as the interim balance sheet provided.     An interim balance sheet as of the en of the corresponding fiscal quarter     of the preceding fiscal year need not be provided unless necessary for an     understanding of the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the registrant's financial     condition. <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="c2"></A>(2) Interim statements of income shall be provided for the     most recent fiscal quarter, for the period between the end of the preceding     fiscal year and the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding     periods of the preceding fiscal year. Such statements may also be presented     for the cumulative twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal     quarter and for the corresponding preceding period. <br>    <br>    <br>    <A NAME="c3"></A>(3) Interim statements of cash flows shall be provided for     the period between the end of the preceding fiscal year and the end of the     most recent fiscal quarter, and for the corresponding period of the preceding     fiscal year. Such statements may also be presented for the cumulative twelve     month period ended during the most recent fiscal quarter and for the corresponding     preceding period. <br>    <br>    <br>    (4) Registrants engaged in seasonal production and sale of a single-crop agricultural     commodity may provide interim statements of income and cash flows for the     twelve month period ended during the most recent fiscal quarter and for the     corresponding preceding period in lieu of the year-to-date statements specified     in (2) and (3) above.   </OL>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="d"></A>(d) <B>Interim review by independent public accountant.</B>   Prior to filing, interim financial statements included in quarterly reports   on <a href="../34forms/form10-Q.html">Form 10-Q</a> must be reviewed by an independent   public accountant using professional standards and procedures for conducting   such reviews, as established by generally accepted auditing standards, as may   be modified or supplemented by the Commission. If, in any filing, the company   states that interim financial statements have been reviewed by an independent   public accountant, a report of the accountant on the review must be filed with   the interim financial statements.<br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="e"></A>(e) <B>Filing of other interim financial information in certain   cases</B>. The Commission may, upon the informal written request of the registrant,   and where consistent with the protection of investors, permit the omission of   any of the interim financial information herein required or the filing in substitution   thereof of appropriate information of comparable character. The Commission may   also by informal written notice require the filing of other information in addition   to, or in substitution for, the interim information herein required in any case   where such information is necessary or appropriate for an adequate presentation   of the financial condition of any person for which interim financial information   is required, or whose financial information is otherwise necessary for the protection   of investors. </OL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>46 FR 12489, Feb. 17, 1981, as amended at 50 FR 25215, June 18, 1985; 50 FR 49533, Dec. 3, 1985; 57 FR 36501, Aug. 13, 1992; 57 FR 45293, Oct. 1, 1992; 64 FR 73389, 73401, Dec. 30, 1999; 73 FR 934, 956, Jan. 4, 2008; TBA FR Apr. 2009 <br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="art10.html">Previous</a><a href="art10.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="art10.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
