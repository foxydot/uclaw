If there are material exchange restrictions or controls   relating to the issuer's reporting currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile,   or the currency in which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure   of this fact shall be made in the financial statements. If the reporting currency   is not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements or convenience   translations shall not be presented, except a translation may be presented of   the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent interim period presented using   the exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet included in the filing,   except that a rate as of the most recent practicable date shall be used if materially   different. <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="c"></A>(c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer   are stated in a currency of a country that has experienced cumulative inflationary   effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most recent three year period,   and have not been recast or otherwise supplemented to include information on   a historical cost/constant currency or current cost basis prescribed or permitted   by appropriate authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary   information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its financial position   and results of operations. <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="d"></A>(d)Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes,   the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions, and those of each   of its material operations (e.g., branches, divisions, subsidiaries, joint ventures,   and similar entities) that is included in the issuer's consolidated financial   statements and not located in a hyperinflationary environment, using the particular   currency of the primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation   conducts its business. Assets and liabilities so determined shall be translated   into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date;   all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses shall be translated at the exchange   rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted   average of the exchange rates during the period; and all translation effects   of exchange rate changes shall be included as a separate component (&quot;cumulative   translation adjustment&quot;) of shareholders' equity. For purposes of this   paragraph, the currency of an operation's primary economic environment is normally   the currency in which cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary   environment is one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more   over the most recent three year period. Departures from the methodology presented   in this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Item 17(c)(2) of <a href="../34forms/form20-F.html">Form   20-F</a>. <br>  <br>  <br>  <A NAME="e"></A>(e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements   in the same currency for all periods for which financial information is presented.   If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is different from   that used in financial statements previously filed with the Commission, the   issuer shall recast its financial statements as if the newly adopted currency   had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing. The   decision to change and the reason for the change in the reporting currency shall   be disclosed in a note to the financial statements in the period in which the   change occurs. </OL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>59 FR 65631, Dec. 20, 1994; 64 FR 53900, 53908, Oct. 5, 1999.<br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center">  <a href="SX3-18.html">Previous</a><a href="art3.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="art3.html">Next</a>   </td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
