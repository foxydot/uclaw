Short-termdebt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose maturities or expiration datesat the time of acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer may be aggregated,in which case the range of interest rates and maturity dates shall be indicated.For issuers of periodic payment plan certificates and unit investment trusts,listseparately:  (i) Trust shares in trusts created or serviced by the depositor or sponsor  of this trust; (ii) trust shares in other trusts; and (iii) securities of  other investment companies.

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities  which is non-income producing. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares  may be deemed to be income producing if, on the respective last interest  payment date or date for the declaration of dividends prior to the date  of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial payment of interest  or a declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in such  case, however, each such issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol  referring to a note to the effect that, on the last interest or dividend  date, only partial interest was paid or partial dividends declared. If,  on such respective last interest or dividend date, no interest was paid  or no cash or in kind dividends declared, the issue shall not be deemed  to be income producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income producing  unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet,  there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.<br>  <br>  <A NAME="6"></A>6. Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted  securities.
