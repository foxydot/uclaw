However, if any security    that is included in &quot;Miscellaneous securities&quot; would otherwise be required    to be included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a    single issue, the remaining securities of that group must nonetheless be listed    as required by notes 3 and 4 even if the remaining securities alone would not    otherwise be required to be listed in this manner (e.g., because the combined    value of the security listed in &quot;Miscellaneous securities&quot; and    the remaining securities of the same issuer exceeds one percent of net asset    value, but the value of the remaining securities alone does not exceed one percent    of net asset value).</li><br><br>    <li>If any securities are listed as &quot;Miscellaneous securities&quot; pursuant    to note 5 or &quot;Other securities&quot; pursuant to note 4, briefly explain    in a footnote what those terms represent.</li><br><br>    <li>Total Column C.

Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares may be deemed to be    income producing if, on the respective last interest payment date or date for    the declaration of dividends prior to the date of the related balance sheet,    there was only a partial payment of interest or a declaration of only a partial    amount of the dividends payable; in such case, however, each such issue shall    be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a note to the effect that,    on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid or partial    dividends declared. If, on such respective last interest or dividend date, no    interest was paid or no cash or in kind dividends declared, the issue shall not    be deemed to be income producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income    producing unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance    sheet, there was at least one dividend paid upon such common shares.</li><br><br>    <li>Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted securities.
