There is a presumption that consolidatedstatements are more meaningful than separate statements and that they areusually necessary for a fair presentation when one entity directly or indirectlyhas a controlling financial interest in another entity. Other particularfacts and circumstances may require combined financial statements, an equitymethod of accounting, or valuation allowances in order to achieve a fairpresentation. In any case, the disclosures required by <a href="SX3A-03.html">Rule3A-03</A> should clearly explain the accounting policies followed by theregistrant in this area, including the circumstances involved in any departurefrom the normal practice of consolidating majority owned subsidiaries andnot consolidating entities that are less than majority owned. Among thefactors that the registrant should consider in determining the most meaningfulpresentation are the following:<OL>  <br><A NAME="a"></A>(a) <B>Majority ownership</B>: Generally, registrantsshall consolidate entities that are majority owned and shall not consolidateentities that are not majority owned. The determination of &quot;majorityownership&quot; requires a careful analysis of the facts and circumstancesof a particular relationship among entities. In rare situations, consolidationof a majority owned subsidiary may not result in a fair presentation, becausethe registrant, in substance, does not have a controlling financial interest(for example, when the subsidiary is in legal reorganization or in bankruptcy). In other situations, consolidationof an entity, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority ownership,is necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operationsof the registrant, because of the existence of a parent-subsidiary relationshipby means other than record ownership of voting stock.   <br><br>  <br><A NAME="b"></A>(b) <B>Different fiscal periods</B>: Generally, registrantsshall not consolidate any entity whose financial statements are as of adate or for periods substantially different from those of the registrant.Rather, the earnings or losses of such entities should be reflected in theregistrant's financial statements on the equity method of accounting. However:  <br><br>  <OL>    <br><A NAME="b1"></A>(1) A difference in fiscal periods does not ofitself justify the exclusion of an entity from consolidation. It ordinarilyis feasible for such entity to prepare, for consolidation purposes, statementsfor a period which corresponds with or closely approaches the fiscal yearof the registrant. Where the difference is not more than 93 days, it isusually acceptable to use, for consolidation purposes, such entity's statementsfor its fiscal period. Such difference, when it exists, should be disclosedas follows: the closing date of the entity should be expressly indicated,and the necessity for the use of different closing dates should be brieflyexplained. Furthermore, recognition should be given by disclosure or otherwiseto the effect of intervening events which materially affect the financialposition or results of operations.     <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b2"></A>(2) Notwithstanding the 93-day provision specified in (b)(l) ahove, in connection with the retroactive combination of financial statements of entities following a &quot;combination between entities under common control,&quot; the financial statements of the constituents may be combined even if their respective fiscal periods do not end within 93 days, except that the financial statements for the latest fiscal year shall be recast to dates which do not differ by more than 93 days, if practicable. Disclosure shall be made of the periods combined and of the sales or revenues, net income before extraordinary items and net income of any interim periods excluded from or included more than once in results of operations as a result of such recasting. </OL>  <br><br>  <br><A NAME="c"></A>(c) <B>Bank Holding Company Act</B>: Registrants shallnot consolidate any subsidiary or group of subsidiaries of a registrantsubject to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/12/ch17.html">BankHolding Company Act of 1956 as amended</A> as to which   <br><br>  <OL>    <br>(1) a decision requiring divestiture has been made, or     <br><br>    <br>(2) there is substantial likelihood that divestiture will be necessaryin order to comply with provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act.   </OL>  <br><br>  <br><A NAME="d"></A>(d) <B>Foreign subsidiaries</B>: Due considerationshall be given to the propriety of consolidating with domestic corporationsforeign subsidiaries which are operated under political, economic or currencyrestrictions. If consolidated, disclosure should be made as to the effect,insofar as this can reasonably be determined, of foreign exchange restrictionsupon the consolidated financial position and operating results of the registrantand its subsidiaries. </OL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>51 FR 17330, May 12, 1986; TBA FR Apr. 2009 <br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="SX3A-01.html">Previous</a><a href="art3A.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="SX3A-03.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
