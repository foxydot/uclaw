Pro forma financial informationshould provide investors with information about the continuing impact ofa particular transaction by showing how it might have affected historicalfinancial statements if the transaction had been consummated at an earliertime. Such statements should assist investors in analyzing the future prospectsof the registrant because they illustrate the possible scope of the changein the registrant's historical financial position and results of operationscaused by the transaction.   <br><br>  <br><A NAME="b"></A>(b) <B>Form and content</B>.   <br><br>  <OL>    <br><A NAME="b1"></A>(1) Pro forma financial information shall consistof a pro forma condensed balance sheet, pro forma condensed statements ofincome, and accompanying explanatory notes. In certain circumstances (i.e.,where a limited number of pro forma adjustments are required and those adjustmentsare easily understood), a narrative description of the pro forma effectsof the transaction may be furnished in lieu of the statements describedherein.     <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b2"></A>(2) The pro forma financial information shall beaccompanied by an introductory paragraph which briefly sets forth a descriptionof     <br><br>    <OL>      <br>(i) the transaction,       <br><br>      <br>(ii) the entities involved, and       <br><br>      <br>(iii) the periods     </OL>    <br><br>    <br>for which the pro forma information is presented. In addition, anexplanation of what the pro forma presentation shows shall be set forth.    <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b3"></A>(3) The pro forma condensed financial information need only include major captions (i.e., the numbered captions) prescribed by the 	applicable sections of this Regulation. Where any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets, the caption may be combined with 	others. When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income attributable to the registrant for the most recent 	three fiscal years, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income attributable to the registrant, 	loss years should be excluded unless losses were incurred in each of the most recent three years, in which case the average 	loss shall be used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, de minimis amounts need not be shown separately. 	In calculating average net income attributable to the registrant, loss years should be excluded unless losses were incurred in each of 	the most recent three years, in which case the average loss shall be used for purposes of this test. Notwithstanding these tests, 	<em>de minimis </em>amounts need not be shown separately.     <br>    <br>    <br><A NAME="b4"></A>(4) Pro forma statements shall ordinarily be incolumnar form showing condensed historical statements, pro forma adjustment,and the pro forma results.     <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b5"></A>(5) The pro forma condensed income statement shalldisclose income (loss) from continuing operations before nonrecurring chargesor credits directly attributable to the transaction. Material nonrecurringcharges or credits and related tax effects which result directly from thetransaction and which will be included in the income of the registrant withinthe 12 months succeeding the transaction shall be disclosed separately.It should be clearly indicated that such charges or credits were not consideredin the pro forma condensed income statement. If the transaction for whichpro forma financial information is presented relates to the dispositionof a business, the pro forma results should give effect to the dispositionand be presented under an appropriate caption.     <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b6"></A>(6) Pro forma adjustments related to the pro formacondensed income statement shall be computed assuming the transaction wasconsummated at the beginning of the fiscal year presented and shall includeadjustments which give effect to events that are     <br><br>    <OL>      <br>(i) directly attributable to the transaction,       <br><br>      <br>(ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the registrant, and      <br><br>      <br>(iii) factually supportable.     </OL>    <br><br>    <br>Pro forma adjustments related to the pro forma condensed balancesheet shall be computed assuming the transaction was consummated at theend of the most recent period for which a balance sheet is required by <a href="SX3-01.html">Rule3-01</A> and shall include adjustments which give effect to events thatare directly attributable to the transaction and factually supportable regardlessof whether they have a continuing impact or are nonrecurring. All adjustmentsshould be referenced to notes which clearly explain the assumptions involved.    <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b7"></A>(7) Historical primary and fully diluted per sharedata based on continuing operations (or net income if the registrant doesnot report either discontinued operations, extraordinary items, or the cumulativeeffects of accounting changes) for the registrant, and primary and fullydiluted pro forma per share data based on continuing operations before nonrecurringcharges or credits directly attributable to the transaction shall be presentedon the face of the pro forma condensed income statement together with thenumber of shares used to compute such per share data. For transactions involvingthe issuance of securities, the number of shares used in the calculationof the pro forma per share data should be based on the weighted averagenumber of shares outstanding during the period adjusted to give effect toshares subsequently issued or assumed to be issued had the particular transactionor event taken place at the beginning of the period presented. If a convertiblesecurity is being issued in the transaction, consideration should be givento the possible dilution of the pro forma per share data.     <br><br>    <br><A NAME="b8"></A>(8) If the transaction is structured in such amanner that significantly different results may occur, additional pro formapresentations shall be made which give effect to the range of possible results.  </OL></OL><HR><OL>  <br><B>Instructions</B>.   <br><br>  <br>1. The historical statement of income used in the pro forma financialinformation shall not report operations of a segment that has been discontinued,extraordinary items, or the cumulative effects of accounting changes. Ifthe historical statement of income includes such items, only the portionof the income statement through &quot;income from continuing operations&quot;(or the appropriate modification thereof) should be used in preparing proforma results.   <br><br>  <br>2. For a business combination, pro forma adjustments for the income statement shallinclude amortization, depreciation and other adjustments based on the allocated purchaseprice of net assets acquired.In some transactions, such as in financial institution acquisitions, thepurchase adjustments may include significant discounts of the historicalcost of the acquired assets to their fair value at the acquisition date.When such adjustments will result in a significant effect on earnings (losses)in periods immediately subsequent to the acquisition which will be progressivelyeliminated over a relatively short period, the effect of the purchase adjustmentson reported results of operations for each of the next five years shouldbe disclosed in a note.   <br><br>  <br>3. For a disposition transaction, the pro forma financial informationshall begin with the historical financial statements of the existing entityand show the deletion of the business to be divested along with the proforma adjustments necessary to arrive at the remainder of the existing entity.For example, pro forma adjustments would include adjustments of interestexpense arising from revised debt structures and expenses which will beor have been incurred on behalf of the business to be divested such as advertisingcosts, executive salaries and other costs.   <br><br>  <br>4. For entities which were previously a component of another entity,pro forma adjustments should include adjustments similar in nature to thosereferred to in Instruction 3 above. Adjustments may also be necessary whencharges for corporate overhead, interest, or income taxes have been allocatedto the entity on a basis other than one deemed reasonable by management.  <br><br>  <br>5. Adjustments to reflect the acquisition of real estate operationsor properties for the pro forma income statement shall include a depreciationcharge based on the new accounting basis for the assets, interest financingon any additional or refinanced debt, and other appropriate adjustmentsthat can be factually supported. See also Instruction 4 above.   <br><br>  <br>6. When consummation of more than one transaction has occurred oris probable during a fiscal year, the pro forma financial information maybe presented on a combined basis; however, in some circumstances (e.g.,depending upon the combination of probable and consummated transactions,and the nature of the filing) it may be more useful to present the pro formafinancial information on a disaggregated basis even though some or all ofthe transactions would not meet the tests of significance individually.For combined presentations, a note should explain the various transactionsand disclose the maximum variances in the pro forma financial informationwhich would occur for any of the possible combinations. If the pro formafinancial information is presented in a proxy or information statement forpurposes of obtaining shareholder approval of one of the transactions, theeffects of that transaction must be clearly set forth.   <br><br>  <br>7. Tax effects, if any, of pro forma adjustments normally should becalculated at the statutory rate in effect during the periods for whichpro forma condensed income statements are presented and should be reflectedas a separate pro forma adjustment. </OL><HR><OL>  <br><A NAME="c"></A>(c) <B>Periods to be presented</B>.   <br><br>  <OL>    <br>(1) A pro forma condensed balance sheet as of the end of the mostrecent period for which a consolidated balance sheet of the registrant isrequired by <a href="SX3-01.html">Rule 3-01</A> shall be filed unless thetransaction is already reflected in such balance sheet.     <br><br>    <br>(2)     <br><br>    <OL>      <br><A NAME="c2i"></A>(i) Pro forma condensed statements of incomeshall be filed for only the most recent fiscal year and for the period fromthe most recent fiscal year end to the most recent interim date for whicha balance sheet is required. A pro forma condensed statement of income maybe filed for the corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year.A pro forma condensed statement of income shall not be filed when the historicalincome statement reflects the transaction for the entire period.       <br><br>      <br>(ii) For a business combination accounted for as a pooling ofinterests, the pro forma income statements (which are in effect a restatementof the historical income statements as if the combination had been consummated)shall be filed for all periods for which historical statements of the registrantare required.     </OL>    <br><br>    <br>(3) Pro forma condensed statements of income shall be presentedusing the registrant's fiscal year end. If the most recent fiscal year endof any other entity involved in the transaction differs from the registrant'smost recent fiscal year end by more than 93 days, the other entity's incomestatement shall be brought up to within 93 days of the registrant's mostrecent fiscal year end, if practicable. This updating could be accomplishedby adding subsequent interim period results to the most recent fiscal year-endinformation and deducting the comparable preceding year interim period results.Disclosure shall be made of the periods combined and of the sales or revenuesand income for any periods which were excluded from or included more thanonce in the condensed pro forma income statements (e.g., an interim periodthat is included both as part of the fiscal year and the subsequent interimperiod). For investment companies subject to <a href="art6.html">Rules 6-01to 6-10</A>, the periods covered by the pro form a statements must be thesame.     <br><br>    <br>(4) Whenever unusual events enter into the determination of theresults shown for the most recently completed fiscal year, the effect ofsuch unusual events should be disclosed and consideration should be givento presenting a pro forma condensed income statement for the most recenttwelve-month period in addition to those required in <a href="#c2i">paragraph(c)(2)(i)</A> above if the most recent twelve-month period is more representativeof normal operations.   </OL></OL><br><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>47 FR 29837, July 9, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 49533, Dec. 3, 1985; TBA FR Apr. 2009 <br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="SX11-01.html">Previous</a><a href="art11.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="SX11-03.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
