In  addition to an appropriate narrative discussion of the allocation and priority  structure of pool cash flows, present the flow of funds graphically if doing  so will aid understanding. In the flow of funds discussion, provide information  regarding any requirements directing cash flows from the pool assets (such  as to reserve accounts, cash collateral accounts or expenses) and the purpose  and operation of such requirements.<br>  <br><LI><A NAME="a.3"></A>In describing the interest rate or rate of return on the  asset-backed securities and how such amounts are payable, explain how the rate  is determined and how  frequently it will be determined. If the rate to be paid can be a combination  of two or more rates (such as the lesser of a variable rate or the actual weighted  average net coupon on the pool assets), provide clear information regarding  each rate and when each rate applies.<br>  <br> <LI><A NAME="a.4"></A>How principal, if any, will be paid on the asset-backed  securities, including maturity dates, amortization or principal distribution  schedules, principal  distribution dates, formulas for calculating principal distributions from the  cash flows and other factors that will affect the timing or amount of principal  payments for each class of securities.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.5"></A>The denominations in which the asset-backed securities  may be issued.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.6"></A>Any specified changes to the transaction structure that  would be triggered upon a default or event of default (such as a change in  distribution priority  among classes).<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.7"></A>Any liquidation, amortization, performance or similar triggers  or events, and the rights of investors or changes to the transaction structure  or flow  of funds if such events were to occur.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.8"></A>Whether the servicer or other party is required to provide  periodic evidence of the absence of a default or of compliance with the terms  of the transaction  agreements.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.9"></A>If applicable, the extent, expressed as a percentage, the  transaction is overcollateralized or undercollateralized as measured by comparing  the principal  balance of the asset-backed securities to the asset pool.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.10"></A>Any provisions contained in other securities that could  result in a cross-default or cross-collateralization.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.11"></A>Any minimum standards, restrictions or suitability requirements  regarding potential investors in purchasing the securities or any restrictions  on ownership  or transfer of the securities.<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.12"></A>Security holder vote required to amend the transaction  documents and allocation of voting rights among security holders.<br><br></ol><LI><A NAME="b"></A><em>Distribution frequency and cash maintenance.</em><br><br><ol type="1"> <LI><A NAME="b.1"></A>Disclose the frequency of distribution dates for the asset-backed   securities and the collection periods for the pool assets.<br> <br><LI><A NAME="b.2"></A>Describe how cash held pending distribution or other uses  is held and invested.

If the amount of such fees or expenses is not fixed,  provide the formula used to determine such fees or expenses. The tabular presentation  should be accompanied by footnotes or other accompanying narrative disclosure  to the extent necessary for an understanding of the timing or amount of such  fees or expenses, such as any restrictions or limits on fees or whether the  estimate may change in certain instances, such as in an event of default (and  how the fees would change in such an instance or the factors that would affect  the change). In addition, through footnote or other accompanying narrative  disclosure, describe if any, and if so how, such fees or expenses can be changed  without notice to, or approval by, security holders and any restrictions on  the ability to change a fee or expense amount, such as due to a change in transaction  party.<br>  <br><LI><A NAME="d"></A><em>Excess cash flow.</em><br><br><ol type="1"> <LI><A NAME="d.1"></A>Describe the disposition of residual or excess cash  flows.
