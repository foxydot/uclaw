(b) constitute     an important part of the current of interstate commerce; (c) involve in large     part the securities of issuers engaged in interstate commerce; (d) involve     the use of credit, directly affect the financing of trade, industry, and transportation     in interstate commerce, and directly affect and influence the volume of interstate     commerce;
