Such reserve payments         may be graduated according to certificate years so that the reserve payment         or payments for the first three certificate years shall amount to at least         80 per centum of the required gross annual payment for such years; the         reserve payment or payments for the fourth certificate year shall amount         to at least 90 per centum of such year's required gross annual payment;         the reserve payment or payments for the fifth certificate year shall amount         to at least 93 per centum of such year's gross annual payment; and for         the sixth and each subsequent certificate year the reserve payment or         payments shall amount to at least 96 per centum of each such year's required         gross annual payment: Provided, That such aggregate reserve payments shall         amount to at least 93 per centum of the aggregate gross annual payments         required to be made by the holder to obtain the maturity of the certificate.         The company may at its option take as loading from the gross payment or         payments for a certificate year, as and when made by the certificate holder,         an amount or amounts equal in the aggregate for such year to not more         than the excess, if any, of the gross payment or payments required to         be made by the holder for such year, over and above the percentage of         the gross annual payment required herein for such year for reserve purposes.         Such loading may be taken by the company prior to or after the setting         up of the reserve payment or payments for such year and the reserve payment         or payments for such year may be graduated and adjusted to correspond         with the amount of the gross payment or payments made by the certificate         holder for such year less the loading so taken.<br>        <br>      <LI><A NAME="i.2"></A>Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection         (d), (A) in respect of any certificate of the installment type, during         the first certificate year, the holder of the certificate, upon surrender         thereof, shall be entitled to a value payable in cash not less than 80         per centum of the amount of the gross payments made on the certificate;         and (B) in respect of any certificate of the installment type, at any         time after the expiration of the first certificate year and prior to maturity,         the holder of the certificate, upon surrender thereof, shall be entitled         to a value payable in cash not less than the then amount of the reserve         for such certificate required by clauses (1) and (2) of subparagraph (D)         of paragraph (2) of subsection (a), less a surrender charge that shall         not exceed 2 per centum of the face or maturity amount of the certificate,         or 15 per centum of the amount of such reserve, whichever is the lesser,         but in no event shall such value be less than 80 per centum of the gross         payments made on the certificate.
