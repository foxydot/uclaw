Any rules and regulations so made by the     Commission, to the extent that they may be inconsistent with the rules of     any such association, shall so long as they remain in force supersede the     rules of the association and be binding upon its members as well as all other     underwriters and dealers to whom they may be applicable.<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="d"></A>Sale of securities except to or through principal underwriter;     price of securities.

Nothing in this subsection shall     prevent a sale made (i) pursuant to an offer of exchange permitted by section     11 [15 USCS &sect; 80a-11] including any offer made pursuant to section 11(b) [15     USCS &sect; 80a-11(b)]; (ii) pursuant to an offer made solely to all registered     holders of the securities, or of a particular class or series of securities     issued by the company proportionate to their holdings or proportionate to     any cash distributions made to them by the company (subject to appropriate     qualifications designed solely to avoid issuance of fractional securities);     or (iii) in accordance with rules and regulations of the Commission made pursuant     to subsection (b) of section 12 [15 USCS &sect; 80a-12(b)].<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="e"></A>Suspension of right of redemption or postponement of date     of payment.
