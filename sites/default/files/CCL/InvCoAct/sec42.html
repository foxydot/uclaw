The Commission may make such investigations     as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated or is about     to violate any provision of this title or of any rule, regulation, or order     hereunder, or to determine whether any action in any court or any proceeding     before the Commission shall be instituted under this title against a particular     person or persons, or with respect to a particular transaction or transactions.     The Commission shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing,     under oath or otherwise as the Commission shall determine, as to all the facts     and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated.<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="b"></A>Administration of oaths and affirmations, subpena of witnesses,     etc. For the purpose of any investigation or any other proceeding under this     title, any member of the Commission, or any officer thereof designated by     it, is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses,     compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any     books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other     records which are relevant or material to the inquiry. Such attendance of     witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any     place in any State or in any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction     of the United States at any designated place of hearing.<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="c"></A>Jurisdiction of courts of United States. In case of contumacy     by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, the Commission may     invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of     which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person     resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony     of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda,     contracts, agreements, and other records. And such court may issue an order     requiring such person to appear before the Commission or member or officer     designated by the Commission, there to produce records, if so ordered, or     to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question;     any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court     as a contempt thereof.
