No person shall serve as a director     of a registered investment company unless elected to that office by the holders     of the outstanding voting securities of such company, at an annual or a special     meeting duly called for that purpose; except that vacancies occurring between     such meetings may be filled in any otherwise legal manner if immediately after     filling any such vacancy at least two-thirds of the directors then holding     office shall have been elected to such office by the holders of the outstanding     voting securities of the company at such an annual or special meeting. In     the event that at any time less than a majority of the directors of such company     holding office at that time were so elected by the holders of the outstanding     voting securities, the board of directors or proper officer of such company     shall forthwith cause to be held as promptly as possible and in any event     within sixty days a meeting of such holders for the purpose of electing directors     to fill any existing vacancies in the board of directors unless the Commission     shall by order extend such period. The foregoing provisions of this subsection     shall not apply to members of an advisory board.<br>    <br>    Nothing herein shall, however, preclude a registered investment company from     dividing its directors into classes if its charter, certificate of incorporation,     articles of association, by-laws, trust indenture, or other instrument or     the law under which it is organized, so provides and prescribes the tenure     of office of the several classes: Provided, That no class shall be elected     for a shorter period than one year or for a longer period than five years     and the term of office of at least one class shall expire each year.<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="b"></A>Term vacancies. Any vacancy on the board of directors of     a registered investment company which occurs in connection with compliance     with section 15(f)(1)(A) [15 USCS &sect; 80a-15(f)(1)(A)] and which must be filled     by a person who is not an interested person of either party to a transaction     subject to section 15(f)(1)(A) [15 USCS &sect; 80a-15(f)(1)(A)] shall be filled     only by a person (1) who has been selected and proposed for election by a     majority of the directors of such company who are not such interested persons,     and (2) who has been elected by the holders of the outstanding voting securities     of such company, except that in the case of the death, disqualification, or     bona fide resignation of a director selected and elected pursuant to clauses     (1) and (2) of this subsection (b), the vacancy created thereby may be filled     as provided in subsection (a).<br>    <br>  <LI><A NAME="c"></A>Trustees of common-law trusts. The foregoing provisions     of this section shall not apply to a common-law trust existing on the date     of enactment of this title [enacted Aug. 22, 1940] under an indenture of trust     which does not provide for the election of trustees by the shareholders. No     natural person shall serve as trustee of such a trust, which is registered     as an investment company, after the holders of record of not less than two-thirds     of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest in such trust have declared     that he be removed from that office either by declaration in writing filed     with the custodian of the securities of the trust or by votes cast in person     or by proxy at a meeting called for the purpose. Solicitation of such a declaration     shall be deemed a solicitation of a proxy within the meaning of section 20(a)     [15 USCS &sect; 80a-20(a)].<br>    <br>    The trustees of such a trust shall promptly call a meeting of shareholders     for the purpose of voting upon the question of removal of any such trustee     or trustees when requested in writing so to do by the record holders of not     less than 10 per centum of the outstanding shares.<br>    <br>    Whenever ten or more shareholders of record who have been such for at least     six months preceding the date of application, and who hold in the aggregate     either shares having a net asset value of at least $ 25,000 or at least 1     per centum of the outstanding shares, whichever is less, shall apply to the     trustees in writing, stating that they wish to communicate with other shareholders     with a view to obtaining signatures to a request for a meeting pursuant to     this subsection (c) and accompanied by a form of communication and request     which they wish to transmit, the trustee shall within five business days after     receipt of such application either--<br>    <br>    <OL Type="1">      <LI><A NAME="c.1"></A>afford to such applicants access to a list of the         names and addresses of all shareholders as recorded on the books of the         trust; or<br>        <br>      <LI><A NAME="c.2"></A>inform such applicants as to the approximate number         of shareholders of record, and the approximate cost of mailing to them         the proposed communication and form of request.<br>        <br>    </OL>    If the trustees elect to follow the course specified in paragraph (2) of this     subsection (c) the trustees, upon the written request of such applicants,     accompanied by a tender of the material to be mailed and of the reasonable     expenses of mailing, shall, with reasonable promptness, mail such material     to all shareholders of record at their addresses as recorded on the books,     unless within five business days after such tender the trustees shall mail     to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the     material to be mailed, a written statement signed by at least a majority of     the trustees to the effect that in their opinion either such material contains     untrue statements of fact or omits to state facts necessary to make the statements     contained therein not misleading, or would be in violation of applicable law,     and specifying the basis of such opinion.<br>    <br>    After opportunity for hearing upon the objections specified in the written     statement so filed, the Commission may, and if demanded by the trustees or     by such applicants shall, enter an order either sustaining one or more of     such objections or refusing to sustain any of them. If the Commission shall     enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections, or if, after the     entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission     shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all objections     so sustained have been met, and shall enter an order so declaring, the trustees     shall mail copies of such material to all shareholders with reasonable promptness     after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender.<br>    <br></OL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Legislative History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>Aug. 22, 1940, ch 686, Title I, &sect; 16, 54 Stat. 813; June 4, 1975, P.L. 94-29, &sect; 28(3), 89 Stat. 165.<br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="sec15.html">Previous</a><a href="index.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="sec17.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
