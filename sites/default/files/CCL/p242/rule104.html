It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to stabilize, to effect any syndicate covering transaction, or to impose a penalty bid, in connection with an offering of any security, in contravention of the provisions of this section. No stabilizing shall be effected at a price that the person stabilizing knows or has reason to know is in contravention of this section, or is the result of activity that is fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive under the securities laws, or any rule or regulation thereunder.<br><br><LI type="a"><A NAME="b"></A>Purpose. Stabilizing is prohibited except for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of a security.<br><br><LI type="a"><A NAME="c"></A>Priority. To the extent permitted or required by the market where stabilizing occurs, any person stabilizing shall grant priority to any independent bid at the same price irrespective of the size of such independent bid at the time that it is entered.<br><br><LI type="a"><A NAME="d"></A>Control of Stabilizing. No sole distributor or syndicate or group stabilizing the price of a security or any member or members of such syndicate or group shall maintain more than one stabilizing bid in any one market at the same price at the same time.<br><br><LI type="a"><A NAME="e"></A>At-the-Market Offerings.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph (f), no stabilizing shall be made at a price higher than the lower of the offering price or the stabilizing bid for the security in the principal market (or, if the principal market is closed, the stabilizing bid in the principal market at its previous close).<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2"></A>Initiating stabilizing.<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.2.i"></A>Initiating stabilizing when the principal market is open.

If both conditions of the preceding sentence are not satisfied, stabilizing may be initiated in any market after the opening of quotations in the principal market at a price no higher than the highest current independent bid for the security in the principal market.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.2.ii"></A>Initiating stabilizing when the principal market is closed.<br><br><OL Type="A"><LI type="A"><A NAME="f.2.ii.A"></A>When the principal market for the security is closed, but immediately before the opening of quotations for the security in the market where stabilizing will be initiated, stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the lower of:<br><br><OL Type="1"><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2.ii.A.1"></A>The price at which stabilizing could have been initiated in the principal market for the security at its previous close; or<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2.ii.A.2"></A>The most recent price at which an independent transaction in the security has been effected in any market since the close of the principal market, if the person stabilizing knows or has reason to know of such transaction.<br><br></OL><LI type="A"><A NAME="f.2.ii.B"></A>When the principal market for the security is closed, but after the opening of quotations in the market where stabilizing will be initiated, stabilizing may be initiated at a price no higher than the lower of:<br><br><OL Type="1"><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2.ii.B.1"></A>The price at which stabilization could have been initiated in the principal market for the security at its previous close; or<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2.ii.B.2"></A>The last independent transaction price for the security in that market if the security has traded in that market on the day stabilizing is initiated or on the last preceding business day and the current asked price in that market is equal to or greater than the last independent transaction price.

If no bona fide market for the security being distributed exists at the time stabilizing is initiated, no stabilizing shall be initiated at a price in excess of the offering price. If stabilizing is initiated before the offering price is determined, then stabilizing may be continued after determination of the offering price at the price at which stabilizing then could be initiated.<br><br></OL><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.3"></A>Maintaining or carrying over a stabilizing bid. A stabilizing bid initiated pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, which has not been discontinued, may be maintained, or carried over into another market, irrespective of changes in the independent bids or transaction prices for the security.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.4"></A>Increasing or reducing a stabilizing bid. A stabilizing bid may be increased to a price no higher than the highest current independent bid for the security in the principal market if the principal market is open, or, if the principal market is closed, to a price no higher than the highest independent bid in the principal market at the previous close thereof. A stabilizing bid may be reduced, or carried over into another market at a reduced price, irrespective of changes in the independent bids or transaction prices for the security.

If a stabilizing bid is expressed in a currency other than the currency of the principal market for the security, such bid may be initiated, maintained, or adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate, consistent with the provisions of this section. If, in initiating, maintaining, or adjusting a stabilizing bid pursuant to this paragraph (f)(5), the bid would be at or below the midpoint between two trading differentials, such stabilizing bid shall be adjusted downward to the lower differential.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.6"></A>Adjustments to stabilizing bid. If a security goes ex-dividend, ex- rights, or ex-distribution, the stabilizing bid shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the dividend, right, or distribution. If, in reducing a stabilizing bid pursuant to this paragraph (f)(6), the bid would be at or below the midpoint between two trading differentials, such stabilizing bid shall be adjusted downward to the lower differential.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.7"></A>Stabilizing of components. When two or more securities are being offered as a unit, the component securities shall not be stabilized at prices the sum of which exceeds the then permissible stabilizing price for the unit.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.8"></A>Special prices.
