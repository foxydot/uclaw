The public float of a company filing an initial registration statement under the Exchange Act shall be determined as of a date within 60 days of the date the registration statement is filed. In the case of an initial public offering of securities, public float shall be computed on the basis of the number of shares outstanding prior to the offering and the estimated public offering price of the securities. <HR><br><br><LI type="1"><a name="a.2"></a>Entering and Exiting the Small Business Disclosure System.<br><br><OL type="i"><LI type="i"><a name="a.2.i"></a>A company that meets the definition of small business issuer may use <a href="../33forms/formSB-2.html">Form SB-2</a> for registration of its securities under the Securities Act; <a href="../34forms/form10-SB.html">Form 10-SB</a> for registration of its securities under the Exchange Act; and Forms <a href="../34forms/form10-KSB.html">10-KSB</a> and <a href="../34forms/form10-QSB.html">10-QSB</a> for its annual and quarterly reports.<br><br><LI type="i"><a name="a.2.ii"></a>For a non-reporting company entering the disclosure system for the first time either by filing a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form SB-2 or a registration statement under the Exchange Act on Form 10-SB, the determination as to whether a company is a small business issuer is made with reference to its revenues during its last fiscal year and public float as of a date within 60 days of the date the registration statement is filed. See Note to paragraph (a) of this Item.<br><br><LI type="i"><a name="a.2.iii"></a>Once a small business issuer becomes a reporting company it will remain a small business issuer until it exceeds the revenue limit or the public float limit at the end of two consecutive years. For example, if a company exceeds the revenue limit for two consecutive years, it will no longer be considered a small business. However, if it exceeds the revenue limit in one year and the next year exceeds the public float limit, but not the revenue limit, it will still be considered a small business.

The determination made for a reporting company at the end of its fiscal year governs all reports relating to the next fiscal year. An issuer may not change from one category to another with respect to its reports under the Exchange Act for a single fiscal year.

Hence, information should be presented in a clear, concise and understandable fashion. Avoid unnecessary details, repetition or the use of technical language. The responses to the items of this Regulation should be brief and to the point.<br><br><LI type="1"><a name="c.2"></a>Small business issuers should consult the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act and Exchange Act for requirements concerning the preparation and filing of documents. Small business issuers should be aware that there are special rules concerning such matters as the kind and size of paper that is allowed and how filings should be bound. These special rules are located in <a href="../33ActRls/regC.html">Regulation C</a> of the Securities Act and in <a href="../34ActRls/reg12B.html">Regulation 12B</a> of the Exchange Act.<br><br></OL><LI type="a"><a name="d"></a>Commission policy on projections. The Commission encourages the use of management's projections of future economic performance that have a reasonable basis and are presented in an appropriate format. The guidelines below set forth the Commission's views on important factors to be considered in preparing and disclosing such projections. (See also <a href="../33ActRls/rule175.html">Rule 175</a> under the Securities Act and <a href="../34ActRls/rule3b-6.html">Rule 3b-6</a> under the Exchange Act).<br><br><OL type="1"><LI type="1"><a name="d.1"></a>Basis for projections. Management has the option to present in Commission filings its good faith assessment of a small business issuer's future performance. Management, however, must have a reasonable basis for such an assessment. An outside review of management's projections may furnish additional support in this regard. If management decides to include a report of such a review in a Commission filing, it should also disclose the qualifications of the reviewer, the extent of the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the registrant, and other material factors concerning the process by which any outside review was sought or obtained. Moreover, in the case of a registration statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be deemed an expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the registration statement.<br><br><LI type="1"><a name="d.2"></a>Format for projections. Traditionally, projections have been given for three financial items generally considered to be of primary importance to investors (revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share), projection information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. However, management should take care to assure that the choice of items projected is not susceptible to misleading inferences through selective projection of only favorable items. It generally would be misleading to present sales or revenue projections without one of the foregoing measures of income. The period that appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances of the company involved. For certain companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two or three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not have a reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year.<br><br><LI type="1"><a name="d.3"></a>Investor understanding. Disclosures accompanying the projections should facilitate investor understanding of the basis for and limitations of projections. The Commission believes that investor understanding would be enhanced by disclosure of the assumptions which in management's opinion are most significant to the projections or are the key factors upon which the financial results of the enterprise depend and encourages disclosure of assumptions in a manner that will provide a frame-work for analysis of the projection. Management also should consider whether disclosure of the accuracy or inaccuracy of previous projections would provide investors with important insights into the limitations of projections.<br><br></OL><LI type="a"><a name="e"></a>Commission policy on security ratings. In view of the importance of security ratings ("ratings") to investors and the marketplace, the Commission permits small business issuers to disclose ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities and preferred stock in registration statements and periodic reports. In addition, the Commission permits, disclosure of ratings assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs") in certain communications deemed not to be a prospectus ("tombstone advertisements"). Below are the Commission's views on important matters to be considered in disclosing security ratings.<br><br><OL type="1"><LI type="1"><a name="e.1"></a> <OL type="i"><LI type="i"><a name="e.1.i"></a>If a small business issuer includes in a filing any rating(s) assigned to a class of securities, it should consider including any other rating assigned by a different NRSRO that is materially different.
