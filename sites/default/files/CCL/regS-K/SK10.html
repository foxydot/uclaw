Management, however, must have a reasonable basis for such an assessment. Although a history of operations or experience in projecting may be among the factors providing a basis for management's assessment, the Commission does not believe that a registrant always must have had such a history or experience in order to formulate projections with a reasonable basis. An outside review of management's projections may furnish additional support for having a reasonable basis for a projection. If management decides to include a report of such a review in a Commission filing, there also should be disclosure of the qualifications of the reviewer, the extent of the review, the relationship between the reviewer and the registrant, and other material factors concerning the process by which any outside review was sought or obtained. Moreover, in the case of a registration statement under the Securities Act, the reviewer would be deemed an expert and an appropriate consent must be filed with the registration statement.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="b.2"></A><B><I>Format for projections. </I></B>In determining the appropriate format for projections included in Commission filings, consideration must be given to, among other things, the financial items to be projected, the period to be covered, and the manner of presentation to be used. Although traditionally projections have been given for three financial items generally considered to be of primary importance to investors (revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share), projection information need not necessarily be limited to these three items. However, management should take care to assure that the choice of items projected is not susceptible of misleading inferences through selective projection of only favorable items. Revenues, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share usually are presented together in order to avoid any misleading inferences that may arise when the individual items reflect contradictory trends. There may be instances, however, when it is appropriate to present earnings (loss) from continuing operations, or income (loss) before extraordinary items in addition to or in lieu of net income (loss). It generally would be misleading to present sales or revenue projections without one of the foregoing measures of income. The period that appropriately may be covered by a projection depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances of the company involved. For certain companies in certain industries, a projection covering a two or three year period may be entirely reasonable. Other companies may not have a reasonable basis for projections beyond the current year. Accordingly, management should select the period most appropriate in the circumstances. In addition, management, in making a projection, should disclose what, in its opinion, is the most probable specific amount or the most reasonable range for each financial item projected based on the selected assumptions. Ranges, however, should not be so wide as to make the disclosures meaningless. Moreover, several projections based on varying assumptions may be judged by management to be more meaningful than a single number or range and would be permitted.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="b.3"></A><B><I>Investor understanding. </I></B><br><br><OL><LI type="i"><A NAME="b.3.i"></A>When management chooses to include its projections in a Commission filing, the disclosures accompanying the projections should facilitate investor understanding of the basis for and limitations of projections. In this regard investors should be cautioned against attributing undue certainty to management's assessment, and the Commission believes that investors would be aided by a statement indicating management's intention regarding the furnishing of updated projections. The Commission also believes that investor understanding would be enhanced by disclosure of the assumptions which in management's opinion are most significant to the projections or are the key factors upon which the financial results of the enterprise depend and encourages disclosure of assumptions in a manner that will provide a framework for analysis of the projection.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="b.3.ii"></A>Management also should consider whether disclosure of the accuracy or inaccuracy of previous projections would provide investors with important insights into the limitations of projections. In this regard, consideration should be given to presenting the projections in a format that will facilitate subsequent analysis of the reasons for differences between actual and forecast results. An important benefit may arise from the systematic analysis of variances between projected and actual results on a continuing basis, since such disclosure may highlight for investors the most significant risk and profit-sensitive areas in a business operation.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="b.3.iii"></A>With respect to previously issued projections, registrants are reminded of their responsibility to make full and prompt disclosure of material facts, both favorable and unfavorable, regarding their financial condition. This responsibility may extend to situations where management knows or has reason to know that its previously disclosed projections no longer have a reasonable basis.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="b.3.iv"></A>Since a registrant's ability to make projections with relative confidence may vary with all the facts and circumstances, the responsibility for determining whether to discontinue or to resume making projections is best left to management. However, the Commission encourages registrants not to discontinue or to resume projections in Commission filings without a reasonable basis.<br><br></OL></OL><LI type="a"><A NAME="c"></A><B><I>Commission policy on security ratings. </I></B>In view of the importance of security ratings (<I>ratings</I>) to investors and the marketplace, the Commission permits registrants to disclose, on a voluntary basis, ratings assigned by rating organizations to classes of debt securities, convertible debt securities and preferred stock in registration statements and periodic reports. In addition, the Commission permits, pursuant to <a href="../33ActRls/rule134.html#a.14">Rule 134(a)(14)</A> under the Securities Act, voluntary disclosure of ratings assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (<I>NRSROs</I>) in certain communications deemed not to be a prospectus (<I>tombstone advertisements</I>). Set forth herein are the Commission's views on important matters to be considered in disclosing security ratings.<br><br><OL><LI type="1"><A NAME="c.1"></A><B><I>Securities Act filings. </I></B><br><br><OL><LI type="i"><A NAME="c.1.i"></A>If a registrant includes in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act any rating(s) assigned to a class of securities, it should consider including: (A) Any other rating intended for public dissemination assigned to such class by a NRSRO (<I>additional NRSRO rating</I>) that is available on the date of the initial filing of the document and that is materially different from any rating disclosed; and (B) the name of each rating organization whose rating is disclosed; each such rating organization's definition or description of the category in which it rated the class of securities; the relative rank of each rating within the assigning rating organization's overall classification system; and a statement informing investors that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

As used in this part, the term smaller reporting company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as defined in Rule 229.1101), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is not a smaller reporting company and that:<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.1.i"></A>Had a public float of less than $ 75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common equity; or<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.1.ii"></A>In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $ 75 million as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public offering price of the shares; or<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.1.iii"></A>In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (i) or (ii) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $ 50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.<br><br></ol><LI type="1"><A NAME="f.2"></A>Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is determined on an annual basis.<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.2.ii"></A>For issuers that are required to file reports under <a href="../34Act/sec13.html#a">section 13(a)</a> or <a href="../34Act/sec15.html#d">15(d)</a> of the Exchange Act, the determination is based on whether the issuer came within the definition of smaller reporting company, using the amounts specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this Item, as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of the issuer's previous fiscal year. An issuer in this category must reflect this determination in the information it provides in its quarterly report on <a href="../34forms/form10-Q.html">Form 10-Q</a> for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company, except that, if a determination based on public float indicates that the issuer is newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose to reflect this determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q following the determination, rather than waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next year.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.2.ii"></A>For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or Exchange Act registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this Item, the issuer must reflect the determination in the information it provides in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which the filing is made, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company. The issuer must redetermine its status at the end of its second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this Item. In the case of a determination based on an initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was not determined to be a smaller reporting company has the option to redetermine its status at the conclusion of the offering covered by the registration statement based on the actual offering price and number of shares sold.<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="f.2.ii"></A>Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company status, it will remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this Item, was less than $ 50 million as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the issuer had no public equity outstanding or no market price for its equity existed, if the issuers had annual revenues of less than $ 40 million during its previous fiscal year.<br><br></ol></OL></ol><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>47 FR 11401, Mar. 16, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 21260, June 5, 1987; 58 FR 14665,Mar. 18, 1993; 58 FR 62029, Nov. 23, 1993; 60 FR 32824, June 23,1995; 64 FR 61408,61443, Nov. 10, 1999; 68 FR 4820, 4831, Jan. 30, 2003; 70 FR 1506, 1593, Jan.7, 2005; 73 FR 934, 956, Jan. 4, 2008. <br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="index.html">Previous</a><a href="index.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="SK101.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
