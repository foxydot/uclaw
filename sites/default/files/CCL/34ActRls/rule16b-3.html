The issuer must believe in good faith that any current or contemplated transaction in  which the director participates will not be required to be disclosed under Item 229.404(a) of this chapter,  based on information readily available to the issuer and the director at the time such director proposes  to act as a Non-Employee Director. At such time as the issuer believes in good faith, based on readily  available information, that a current or contemplated transaction with a director will be required to be  disclosed under Item 229.404(a) in a future filing, the director no longer is eligible to serve as a  Non-Employee Director; provided, however, that this determination does not result in retroactive  loss of a Rule 16b-3 exemption for a transaction previously approved by the director while serving  as a Non-Employee Director consistent with this note. In making the determinations specified in this  Note, the issuer may rely on information it obtains from the director, for example, pursuant to a  response to an inquiry.</OL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>56 FR 7265, Feb. 21, 1991, as amended at 56 FR 19927, May 1, 1991; 57 FR 28781, June 29, 1992; 58 FR 36866, July 9, 1993; 59 FR 42448, Aug. 17, 1994; 60 FR40994, Aug. 11, 1995; 61 FR 30376, 30393, June 14, 1996; 70 FR 46080, Aug. 9, 2005; 71 FR 53158, 53263, Sept. 8, 2006. <br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="rule16b-1.html">Previous</a><a href="reg16B.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="rule16b-5.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
