This statement contains important information – andyou should read it carefully before you sign it, and before you decide to purchase or sell apenny stock.<br><br>In addition to obtaining your signature, the SEC requires your broker to wait at least twobusiness days after sending you this statement before executing your first trade to giveyou time to carefully consider your trade.	<CENTER>	<H4>Penny stocks can be very risky.</H4></CENTER></OL><UL>	<LI>Penny stocks are low-priced shares of small companies. Penny stocks may tradeinfrequently – which means that it may be difficult to sell penny stock shares once youhave them. Because it may also be difficult to find quotations for penny stocks, they maybe impossible to accurately price. <strong><em>Investors in penny stock should beprepared for thepossibility that they may lose their whole investment</em></strong>.<br>	<br>  <LI>While penny stocks generally trade over-the-counter, they may also trade on U.S.securities exchanges, facilities of U.S. exchanges, or foreign exchanges. You shouldlearn about the market in which the penny stock trades to determine how much demandthere is for this stock and how difficult it will be to sell. Be especially careful if yourbroker is offering to sell you newly issued penny stock that has no established tradingmarket.<br><br><LI>The securities you are considering have not been approved or disapproved by the SEC.Moreover, the SEC has not passed upon the fairness or the merits of this transaction norupon the accuracy or adequacy of the information contained in any prospectus or anyother information provided by an issuer or a broker or dealer.<br>	<br>		<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Information you should get.</H4>	  <LI>In addition to this statement, your broker is required to give you a statement of yourfinancial situation and investment goals explaining why his or her firm has determined thatpenny stocks are a suitable investment for you. In addition, your broker is required to obtainyour agreement to the proposed penny stock transaction.<br><br>  <LI><strong><em>Before you buy penny stock</em></strong>, federal law requires your salesperson to tell you the “offer”and the “bid” on the stock, and the “compensation” the salesperson and the firm receivefor the trade. The firm also must send a confirmation of these prices to you after thetrade. You will need this price information to determine what profit or loss, if any, youwill have when you sell your stock.<br>	<br>  <LI>The offer price is the wholesale price at which the dealer is willing to sell stock to otherdealers. The bid price is the wholesale price at which the dealer is willing to buy thestock from other dealers. In its trade with you, the dealer may add a retail charge to thesewholesale prices as compensation (called a “markup” or “markdown”).	(called a &quot;markup&quot; or &quot;markdown&quot;).<br>	<br>	  <LI>The difference between the bid and the offer price is the dealer’s “spread.” A spread thatis large compared with the purchase price can make a resale of a stock very costly. To beprofitable when you sell, the bid price of your stock must rise above the amount of thisspread and the compensation charged by both your selling and purchasing dealers.    Rememberthat if the dealer has no bid price, you may not be able to sell the stock afteryou buy it, and may lose your whole investment.<br>	<br>  <LI><strong><em>After you buy penny stock</em></strong>, your brokerage firm must send you a monthly accountstatement that gives an estimate of the value of each penny stock in your account, if thereis enough information to make an estimate. If the firm has not bought or sold any pennystocks for your account for six months, it can provide these statements every threemonths.<br><br><LI>Additional information about low-priced securities – including penny stocks – isavailable on the SEC’s Web site at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/microcapstock.htm">http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/microcapstock.htm</a>.In addition, your broker will send you a copy of this information upon request. The SECencourages you to learn all you can before making this investment.<br>	<br>	<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Brokers' duties and customer's rights and remedies.</H4>  <LI>Remember that your salesperson is not an impartial advisor – he or she is being paid tosell you stock. Do not rely only on the salesperson, but seek outside advice before youbuy any stock. You can get the disciplinary history of a salesperson or firm from NASDat 1-800-289-9999 or contact NASD via the Internet at <a href="http://www.nasd.com">www.nasd.com</a>. You can also getadditional information from your state securities official. The North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, Inc. can give you contact information for your state. Youcan reach NASAA at (202) 737-0900 or via the Internet at <a href="http://www.nasaa.org">www.nasaa.org</a><br><br>	<LI>If you have problems with a salesperson, contact the firm’s compliance officer. You canalso contact the securities regulators listed above. Finally, if you are a victim of fraud,you may have rights and remedies under state and federal law. In addition to theregulators listed above, you also may contact the SEC with complaints at (800) SEC-0330 or via the Internet at <a href="mailto:help@sec.gov">help@sec.gov</a>.<br>	<br>	<br>      <br>      <br>	 <br>	<br></UL><HR><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><H3><font color="#FC1921"><A NAME="history">Regulatory History</A></FONT></H3></DIV><br>57 FR 18035, Apr. 28, 1992, as amended at 57 FR 31446, July 16, 1992; 58 FR 37417,July 12, 1993; 70 FR 40614, 40632, July 13, 2005.<br><br><a href="#top">Return to top</a><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="rule15g-9.html">Previous</a><a href="reg15D.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="reg15D.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
