At the same time, where adequate current information concerning the issuer is available to the public, the rule permits the public sale in ordinary transactions of limited amounts of securities owned by persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with the issuer and by persons who have acquired restricted securities of the issuer.<br><br>Certain basic principles are essential to an understanding of the requirement ofregistration in the Act:<OL>	<LI type="1">If any person utilizes the jurisdictional means to sell any non-exempt	security to any other person, the security must be registered unless a statutory	exemption can be found for the transaction.<br>	<br>		<LI type="1">In addition to the exemptions found in <a href="../33Act/sec3.html">Section 3</A>, four exemptions applicable to transactions in securities are contained in <a href="../33Act/sec4.html">Section 4</A>. Three of these Section 4 exemptions are clearly not available to anyone acting as an <i>underwriter</i> of securities. (The fourth, found in Section 4(4), is available only to those who act as brokers under certain limited circumstances.) An understanding of the term <i>underwriter</i> is therefore important to anyone who wishes to determine whether or not an exemption from registration is available for his sale of securities. </OL><P><br>The term underwriter is broadly defined in <a href="../33Act/sec2.html#a.11">Section 2(a)(11)</A> of the Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any security, or participates or has a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition has traditionally focused on the words <i>with a view to</i> in the phrase <i>purchased from an issuer with a view to * * * distribution</i>. Thus, an investment banking firm which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly an <i>underwriter</i> under that Section. Individual investors who are not professionals in the securities business may also be <i>underwriters</i> within the meaning of that term as used in the Act if they act as links in a chain of transactions through which securities move from an issuer to the public. Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser at the time of his acquisition, subsequent acts and circumstances have been considered to determine whether such person took with a view to distribution at the time of his acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on factors such as the length of time the person has held the securities and whether there has been an unforeseeable change in circumstances of the holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon such factors as the above has not assured adequate protection of investors through the maintenance of informed trading markets and has led to uncertainty in the application of the registration provisions of the Act. <br><br>It should be noted that the statutory language of Section 2(a)(11) is in the disjunctive. Thus, it isinsufficient to conclude that a person is not an underwriter solely because he did not purchase securities from an issuer with a view to their distribution. It must also be established that the person is not offering or selling for an issuer in connection with the distribution of the securities, does not participate or have a direct or indirect participation in any such undertaking, and does not participate or have a participation in the direct or indirect underwriting of such an undertaking. <br><br>In determining when a person is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution severalfactors must be considered. <br><br>First, the purpose and underlying policy of the Act to protect investors requiresthat there be adequate current information concerning the issuer, whether the resalesof securities by persons result in a distribution or are effected in trading transactions.Accordingly, the availability of the rule is conditioned on the existence of adequatecurrent public information. <br><br>Secondly, a holding period prior to resale is essential, among other reasons, to assure that those persons who buy under a claim of a Section 4(2) exemption have assumed the economic risks of investment, and therefore are not acting as conduits for sale to the public of unregistered securities, directly or indirectly, on behalf of an issuer. It should be noted, that there is nothing in <a href="../33Act/sec2.html#a.11">Section 2(a)(11)</A> which places a time limit on a person's status as an underwriter. The public has the same need for protection afforded by registration whether the securities are distributed shortly after their purchase or after a considerable length of time. <br><br>A third factor, which must be considered in determining what is deemed not to constitute a <i>distribution,</i> is the impact of the particular transaction or transactions on the trading markets. Section 4(1) was intended to exempt only routine trading transactions between individual investors with respect to securities already issued and not to exempt distributions by issuers or acts of other individuals who engage in steps necessary to such distributions. Therefore, a person reselling securities under Section 4(1) of the Act must sell the securities in such limited quantities and in such a manner as not to disrupt the trading markets. The larger the amount of securities involved, the more likely it is that such resales may involve methods of offering and amounts of compensation usually associated with a distribution rather than routine trading transactions. Thus, solicitation of buy orders or the payment of extra compensation are not permitted by the rule. <br><br>In summary, if the sale in question is made in accordance with <I>all</I> of theprovisions of the rule, as set forth below, any person who sells restricted securitiesshall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such securities and thereforenot an underwriter thereof. The rule also provides that any person who sells restrictedor other securities on behalf of a person in a control relationship with the issuershall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such securities and thereforenot to be an underwriter thereof, if the sale is made in accordance with <I>all</I>the conditions of the rule.<HR><br><br><OL Type="a"><LI type="a"><A NAME="a"></A><i>Definitions.</i> The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this rule.<br><br><OL><LI type="1"><A NAME="a.1"></A>An <i>affiliate</i> of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="a.2"></A>The term <i>person</i> when used with reference to a person for whose account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this rule includes, in addition to such person, all of the following persons:<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.2.i"></A>Any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.2.ii"></A>Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own ten percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such persons serve as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity; and<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.2.iii"></A>Any corporation or other organization (other than the issuer) in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are the beneficial owners collectively of ten percent or more of any class of equity securities or ten percent or more of the equity interest.<br><br></OL><LI type="1"><A NAME="a.3"></A>The term <i>restricted securities</i> means:<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.3.i"></A>Securities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering;<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.3.ii"></A>Securities acquired from the issuer that are subject to the resale limitations of <a href="rule502.html#d">Rule 502(d)</A> under Regulation D or <a href="rule701.html#c">Rule 701(c)</A>;<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.3.iii"></A>Securities acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions meeting the requirements of <a href="rule144A.html">Rule 144A</A>;<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.3.iv"></A>Securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction subject to the conditions of <a href="regCE.html">Regulation CE</A>;<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.3.v"></A>Equity securities of domestic issuers acquired in a transaction or chain of transactions subject to the conditions of <a href="rule901.html">Rule 901</A> or <a href="rule903.html">Rule 903</A> under Regulation S (Rules 901 through 905 and Preliminary Notes);<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.3.vi"></A>Securities acquired in a transaction made under <a href="rule801.html">Rule 801</a> to the same extent and proportion that the securities held by the security holder of the class with respect to which the rights offering was made were as of the record date for the rights offering "restricted securities" within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3); and<br><br><LI><A NAME="a.3.vii"></A>Securities acquired in a transaction made under <a href="rule802.html">Rule 802</a> to the same extent and proportion that the securities that were tendered or exchanged in the exchange offer or business combination were "restricted securities" within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(3).<br><br></OL></OL><LI type="a"><A NAME="b"></A><i>Conditions to Be Met.</i> Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities of an issuer for his own account, or any person who sells restricted or any other securities for the account of an affiliate of the issuer of such securities, shall be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of such securities and therefore not to be an underwriter thereof within the meaning of <a href="../33Act/sec2.html#a.11">Section 2(a)(11)</A> of the Act if all of the conditions of this rule are met.<br><br><LI type="a"><A NAME="c"></A><i>Current Public Information.</i> There shall be available adequate current public information with respect to the issuer of the securities.
