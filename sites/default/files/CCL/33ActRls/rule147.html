Congress, however, provided certain exemptions in the Act from such registration provisions where there was no practical need for registration or where the benefits of registration were too remote. Among those exemptions is that provided by Section 3(a)(11) of the Act for transactions in &quot;any security which is a part of an issue offered and sold only to persons resident within a single State or Territory, where the issuer of such security is a person resident and doing business within . . . such State or Territory.&quot; The legislative history of that Section suggests that the exemption was intended to apply only to issues genuinely local in character, which in reality represent local financing by local industries, carried out through local investment. Rule 147 is intended to provide more objective standards upon which responsible local businessmen intending to raise capital from local sources may rely in claiming the Section 3(a)(11) exemption. <P>All of the terms and conditions of the rule must be satisfied in order for the	rule to be available. These are:	<P>	<OL Type="i">		<LI TYPE="i">that the issuer be a resident of and doing business within the state		or territory in which all offers and sales are made; and		<P>		<LI TYPE="i">that no part of the issue be offered or sold to nonresidents within the period of time specified in the rule. For purposes of the rule the definition of &quot;issuer&quot; in <a href="../33Act/sec2.html#a.4">Section 2(a)(4)</A> of the Act shall apply. <P>	</OL>	All offers, offers to sell, offers for sale, and sales which are part of the same	issue must meet all of the conditions of Rule 147 for the rule to be available. The	determination whether offers, offers to sell, offers for sale and sales of securities	are part of the same issue (i.e., are deemed to be &quot;integrated&quot;) will continue	to be a question of fact and will depend on the particular circumstances. See Securities	Act of 1933 Release No. 4434 (December 6, 1961). Release 33-4434 indicates that in	determining whether offers and sales should be regarded as part of the same issue	and thus should be integrated any one or more of the following factors may be determinative:	<P>	<OL Type="i">		<LI TYPE="i">Are the offerings part of a single plan of financing;		<P>		<LI TYPE="i">Do the offerings involve issuance of the same class of securities;		<P>		<LI TYPE="i">Are the offerings made at or about the same time;		<P>		<LI TYPE="i">Is the same type of consideration to be received; and		<P>		<LI TYPE="i">Are the offerings made for the same general purpose.		<P>	</OL>	Subparagraph (b)(2) of the rule, however, is designed to provide certainty to the extent feasible by identifying certain types of offers and sales of securities which will be deemed not part of an issue, for purposes of the rule only. <P>Persons claiming the availability of the rule have the burden of proving that they have satisfied all of its provisions. However, the rule does not establish exclusive standards for complying with the <a href="../33Act/sec3.html#a.11">Section 3(a)(11)</A> exemption. The exemption would also be available if the issuer satisfied the standards set forth in relevant administrative and judicial interpretations at the time of the offering but the issuer would have the burden of proving the availability of the exemption. Rule 147 relates to transactions exempted from the registration requirements of <a href="../33Act/sec5.html">Section 5</A> of the Act by Section 3(a)(11). Neither the rule nor Section 3(a)(11) provides an exemption from the registration requirements of <a href="../34Act/sec12.html#g">Section 12(g)</A> of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, the civil liability provisions of <a href="../33Act/sec12.html#a.2">Section 12(a)(2)</A> of the Act or other provisions of the federal securities laws. <P>Finally, in view of the objectives of the rule and the purposes and policies underlying	the Act, the rule shall not be available to any person with respect to any offering	which, although in technical compliance with the rule, is part of a plan or scheme	by such person to make interstate offers or sales of securities. In such cases registration	pursuant to the Act is required.	<P>	<LI TYPE="1"><A NAME="prelimnote.4"></A> The rule provides an exemption for offers and sales by the issuer only. It is not available for offers or sales of securities by other persons. Section 3(a)(11) of the Act has been interpreted to permit offers and sales by persons controlling the issuer, if the exemption provided by that Section would have been available to the issuer at the time of the offering. See Securities Act Release No. 4434 (December 6, 1961). Controlling persons who want to offer or sell securities pursuant to Section 3(a)(11) may continue to do so in accordance with applicable judicial and administrative interpretations. </OL><P><HR><OL Type="a">	<LI TYPE="a"><A NAME="a"></A> Transactions Covered. <br>	<br>	Offers, offers to sell, offers for sale and sales by an issuer of its securities	made in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this rule shall be deemed	to be part of an issue offered and sold only to persons resident and doing business	within such state or territory, within the meaning of <a href="../33Act/sec3.html#a.11">Section	3(a)(11)</A> of the Act.	<P>	<LI TYPE="a"><A NAME="b"></A> Part of an Issue.	<P>	<OL Type="1">		<LI TYPE="1"><A NAME="b.1"></A> For purposes of this rule, all securities of the		issuer which are part of an issue shall be offered, offered for sale or sold in accordance		with all of the terms and conditions of this rule.		<P>		<LI TYPE="1"><A NAME="b.2"></A> For purposes of this rule only, an issue shall be		deemed not to include offers, offers to sell, offers for sale or sales of securities		of the issuer pursuant to the exemptions provided by <a href="../33Act/sec3.html">Section		3</A> or <a href="../33Act/sec4.html#2">Section 4(2)</A> of the Act or pursuant to		a registration statement filed under the Act, that take place prior to the six month		period immediately preceding or after the six month period immediately following		any offers, offers for sale or sales pursuant to this rule, Provided, That, there		are during either of said six month periods no offers, offers for sale or sales of		securities by or for the issuer of the same or similar class as those offered, offered		for sale or sold pursuant to the rule.	</OL>	<P><HR><b>Note:</b> In the event that securities of the same or similar class as those offered pursuant to the rule are offered, offered for sale or sold less than six months prior to or subsequent to any offer, offer for sale or sale pursuant to this rule, see <a href="#PrelimNote.3">Preliminary Note 3</A> hereof, as to which offers, offers to sell, offers for sale, or sales are part of an issue. <HR>	<LI TYPE="a"><A NAME="c"></A> Nature of the Issuer.	<P>The issuer of the securities shall at the time of any offers and the sales be	a person resident and doing business within the state or territory in which all of	the offers, offers to sell, offers for sale and sales are made.	<P>	<OL Type="1">		<LI TYPE="1"><A NAME="c.1"></A>The issuer shall be deemed to be a resident of the		state or territory in which:		<P>		<OL Type="i">			<LI TYPE="i"><A NAME="c.1.i"></A>it is incorporated or organized, if a corporation,			limited partnership, trust or other form of business organization that is organized			under state or territorial law;			<P>			<LI TYPE="i"><A NAME="c.1.ii"></A>its principal office is located, if a general partnership			or other form of business organization that is not organized under any state or territorial			law;			<P>			<LI TYPE="i"><A NAME="c.1.iii"></A>his principal residence is located, if an individual.			<P>		</OL>		<LI TYPE="1"><A NAME="c.2"></A>The issuer shall be deemed to be doing business within		a state or territory if:		<P>		<OL Type="i">			<LI TYPE="i"><A NAME="c.2.i"></A>the issuer derived at least 80 percent of its gross			revenues and those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis			<P>			<OL Type="A">				<LI TYPE="A"><A NAME="c.2.i.A"></A>for its most recent fiscal year, if the first				offer of any part of the issue is made during the first six months of the issuer's				current fiscal year;
