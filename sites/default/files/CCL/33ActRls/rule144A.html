This section relates solely to the application of <a href="../33Act/sec5.html">section5</A> of the Act and not to antifraud or other provisions of the federal securitieslaws.<br><br>2. Attempted compliance with this section does not act as an exclusive election;any seller hereunder may also claim the availability of any other applicable exemptionfrom the registration requirements of the Act.<br><br>3. In view of the objective of this section and the policies underlying the Act,this section is not available with respect to any transaction or series of transactionsthat, although in technical compliance with this section, is part of a plan or schemeto evade the registration provisions of the Act. In such cases, registration underthe Act is required.<br><br>4. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any issuer or any other person tocomply with the securities registration or broker-dealer registration requirementsof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the <I>Exchange Act)</I>, whenever such requirementsare applicable.<br><br>5. Nothing in this section obviates the need for any person to comply with any applicablestate law relating to the offer or sale of securities.<br><br>6. Securities acquired in a transaction made pursuant to the provisions of this section are deemed to be <I>restricted securities</I> within the meaning of <a href="rule144.html#a.3">Rule 144(a)(3)</A>.<br><br>7.
