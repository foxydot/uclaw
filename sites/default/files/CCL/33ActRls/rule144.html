Therefore, an   understanding of the term "underwriter" is important in determining whether or   not the Section 4(1) exemption from registration is available for the sale of   the securities.<BR></OL><P><br>  The term &quot;underwriter&quot; is broadly defined in <a href="../33Act/sec2.html#a.11">Section 2(a)(11)</a> of the Securities   Act to mean any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to, or   offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the distribution of any   security, or participates, or has a direct or indirect participation in any such   undertaking, or participates or has a participation in the direct or indirect   underwriting of any such undertaking. The interpretation of this definition   traditionally has focused on the words "with a view to" in the phrase "purchased   from an issuer with a view to * * *distribution." An investment banking firm   which arranges with an issuer for the public sale of its securities is clearly   an &quot;underwriter&quot; under that section. However, individual investors who are not   professionals in the securities business also may be "underwriters" if they act   as links in a chain of transactions through which securities move from an issuer   to the public.<BR>  <BR>   Since it is difficult to ascertain the mental state of the purchaser at the time   of an acquisition of securities, prior to and since the adoption of Rule 144,   subsequent acts and circumstances have been considered to determine whether the   purchaser took the securities "with a view to distribution" at the time of the   acquisition. Emphasis has been placed on factors such as the length of time the   person held the securities and whether there has been an unforeseeable change in   circumstances of the holder. Experience has shown, however, that reliance upon   such factors alone has led to uncertainty in the application of the registration   provisions of the Act.<BR>  <br>  The Commission adopted Rule 144 to establish specific criteria for determining   whether a person is not engaged in a distribution. Rule 144 creates a safe   harbor from the Section 2(a)(11) definition of "underwriter." A person   satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not   to be engaged in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an   underwriter of the securities for purposes of Section 2(a)(11). Therefore, such   a person is deemed not to be an underwriter when determining whether a sale is   eligible for the Section 4(1) exemption for "transactions by any person other   than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer." If a sale of securities complies with   all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144:<BR>  <br><OL Type="1">  <LI type="1"><A NAME="prelim.1"></A>Any affiliate or other person who sells restricted securities will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction;<br>  <br><LI type="1"><A NAME="prelim.2"></A>Any person who sells restricted or other securities on behalf of an affiliate of the issuer will be deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore not an underwriter for that transaction; and<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="prelim.3"></A>The purchaser in such transaction will receive securities that are not restricted securities.<br><br></ol><p>Rule 144 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 144 still may claim any other available exemption under the Act for the sale of the securities. The Rule 144 safe harbor is not available to any person with respect to any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with Rule 144, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Act.</p>  <br>  <br><HR><br><br><OL Type="a"><LI type="a"><A NAME="a"></A><i>Definitions.</i> The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this rule.<br><br><OL><LI type="1"><A NAME="a.1"></A>An <i>affiliate</i> of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.<br><br><LI type="1"><A NAME="a.2"></A>The term <i>person</i> when used with reference to a person for whose account securities are to be sold in reliance upon this rule includes, in addition to such person, all of the following persons:<br><br><OL Type="i"><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.2.i"></A>Any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of such spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person;<br><br><LI type="i"><A NAME="a.2.ii"></A>Any trust or estate in which such person or any of the persons specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section collectively own ten percent or more of the total beneficial interest or of which any of such persons serve as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity;
