Such requests may be made	in writing or orally, provided that, if an oral request is to be made, a letter indicating	that fact and stating that the registrant and the managing or principal underwriters	are aware of their obligations under the Act must accompany the registration statement	for a pre-effective amendment thereto) at the time of filing with the Commission.	Written requests may be sent to the Commission by facsimile transmission. If, by	reason of the expected arrangement in connection with the offering, it is to be requested	that the registration statement shall become effective at a particular hour of the	day, the Commission must be advised to that effect not later than the second business	day before the day which it is desired that the registration statement shall become	effective. A person's request for acceleration will be considered confirmation of	such person's awareness of the person's obligations under the Act. Not later than	the time of filing the last amendment prior to the effective date of the registration	statement, the registrant shall inform the Commission as to whether or not the amount	of compensation to be allowed or paid to the underwriters and any other arrangements	among the registrant, the underwriters and other broker dealers participating in	the distribution, as described in the registration statement, have been reviewed	to the extent required by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and	such Association has issued a statement expressing no objections to the compensation	and other arrangements.<br>	<br>		<LI type="a"><A NAME="b"></A> Having due regard to the adequacy of information respecting	the registrant theretofore available to the public, to the facility with which the	nature of the securities to be registered, their relationship to the capital structure	of the registrant issuer and the rights of holders thereof can be understood, and	to the public interest and the protection of investors, as provided in <a href="../33Act/sec8.html#a">section	8(a)</A> of the Act, it is the general policy of the Commission, upon request, as	provided in paragraph (a) of this section, to permit acceleration of the effective	date of the registration statement as soon as possible after the filing of appropriate	amendments, if any. In determining the date on which a registration statement shall	become effective, the following are included in the situations in which the Commission	considers that the statutory standards of <a href="../33Act/sec8.html#a">section	8(a)</A> may not be met and may refuse to accelerate the effective date:<br>	<br>	<br>		<OL Type="1">		<LI type="1"><A NAME="b.1"></A> Where there has not been a bona fide effort to make		the prospectus reasonably concise, readable, and in compliance with the plain English		requirements of <a href="../33ActRls/rule421.html#d">Rule 421(d)</A> of Regulation		C in order to facilitate an understanding of the information in the prospectus.<br>		<br>				<LI type="1"><A NAME="b.2"></A> Where the form of preliminary prospectus, which has		been distributed by the issuer or underwriter, is found to be inaccurate or inadequate		in any material respect, until the Commission has received satisfactory assurance		that appropriate correcting material has been sent to all underwriters and dealers		who received such preliminary prospectus or prospectuses in quantity sufficient for		their information and the information of others to whom the inaccurate or inadequate		material was sent.<br>		<br>				<LI type="1"><A NAME="b.3"></A> Where the Commission is currently making an investigation		of the issuer, a person controlling the issuer, or one of the underwriters, if any,		of the securities to be offered, pursuant to any of the Acts administered by the		Commission.<br>		<br>				<LI type="1"><A NAME="b.4"></A> Where one or more of the underwriters, although firmly		committed to purchase securities covered by the registration statement, is subject		to and does not meet the financial responsibility requirements of <a href="../34ActRls/rule15c3-1.html">Rule		15c3-1</A> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
