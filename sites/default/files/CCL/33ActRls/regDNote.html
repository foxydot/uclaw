Issuers are reminded of their obligation to provide	such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the information	required under this regulation, in light of the circumstances under which it is furnished,	not misleading. <br>	<br>		<LI type="1">Nothing in these rules obviates the need to comply with any applicable	state law relating to the offer and sale of securities. Regulation D is intended	to be a basic element in a uniform system of Federal-State limited offering exemptions	consistent with the provisions of sections <a href="../33Act/sec18.html">18</A> and	<a href="../33Act/sec19.html#c">19(c)</A>of the Act. In those states that have adopted	Regulation D, or any version of Regulation D, special attention should be directed	to the applicable state laws and regulations, including those relating to registration	of person who receive remuneration in connection with the offer and sale of securities,	to disqualification of issuers and other persons associated with offerings based	on state administrative orders or judgments, and to requirements for filings of notices	of sales. <br>	<br>		<LI type="1">Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation D does not act as an	exclusive election; the issuer can also claim the availability of any other applicable	exemption. For instance, an issuer's failure to satisfy all the terms and conditions	of <a href="rule506.html">Rule 506</A> shall not raise any presumption that the exemption	provided by <a href="../33Act/sec4.html#2">section 4(2)</A> of the Act is not available.	<br>	<br>		<LI type="1">These rules are available only to the issuer of the securities and not	to any affiliate of that issuer or to any other person for resales of the issuer's	securities. The rules provide an exemption only for the transactions in which the	securities are offered or sold by the issuer, not for the securities themselves.	<br>	<br>		<LI type="1">These rules may be used for business combinations that involve sales	by virtue of <a href="rule145.html#a">rule 145(a)</A> or otherwise. <br>	<br>		<LI type="1">In view of the objectives of these rules and the policies underlying	the Act, regulation D is not available to any issuer for any transaction or chain	of transactions that, although in technical compliance with these rules, is part	of a plan or scheme to evade the registration provisions of the Act. In such cases,	registration under the Act is required. <br>	<br>		<LI type="1">Securities offered and sold outside the United States in accordance	with <a href="regS.html">Regulation S</A> need not be registered under the Act. See	Release No. 33-6863.Regulation S may be relied upon for such offers and sales even	if coincident offers and sales are made in accordance with Regulation D inside the	United States. Thus, for example, persons who are offered and sold securities in	accordance with Regulation S would not be counted in the calculation of the number	of purchasers under Regulation D. Similarly, proceeds from such sales would not be	included in the aggregate offering price. The provisions of this note, however, do	not apply if the issuer elects to rely solely on Regulation D for offers or sales	to persons made outside the United States. <br>	<br>	</OL><hr><!--Sequential Linkers--><table id="seqlinker" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="navbarbot"><tr><td align="center"><a href="regD.html">Previous</a><a href="regD.html">&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;Contents&nbsp;&#8226;&nbsp;</a><a href="rule501.html">Next</a></td></tr></table><!--End Sequential Linkers--><br><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 align="center" width="100%" class="main">  <tr>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ul.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" height="8" background="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_top.gif" width="10" height="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="8" height="8"><img src="../Images/cbox/corner_ur.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">    <td width="8" height="100%" background="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif"><img src="../Images/cbox/box_left.gif" height="10" width="8" border="0"></td>    <td width="100%" align="left" valign="middle">            <table width="100%" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="center" valign="top">        <tr>          <td class="small">            <p><strong>Notice to Users:</strong> The Deskbook is made available              with the understanding that the University of Cincinnati College              of Law is not engaged in rendering legal, accounting or other professional              services.
