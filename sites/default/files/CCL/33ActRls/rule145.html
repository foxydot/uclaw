The thrust of the rule is that an <I>offer</I>, <I>offer to sell</I>, <I>offer for sale</I>, or <I>sale</I> occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security. Rule 145 embodies the Commission's determination that such transactions are subject to the registration requirements of the Act, and that the previously existing <I>no-sale</I> theory of <a href="rule133.html">Rule 133</a> is no longer consistent with the statutory purposes of the Act. <I>See</I> Release No. 33-5316 (October 6, 1972) [37 FR 23631].
