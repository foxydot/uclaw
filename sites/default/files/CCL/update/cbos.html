      <p>The Securities Lawyer's Deskbook contains the text of the basic federal
        securities laws and regulations, as well as links to the principal Securities
        and Exchange Commission forms under those laws and regulations. The Deskbook
        is designed primarily for use by legal practitioners and scholars, securities
        professionals, and corporate officers. It can also be used as a supplement
        in law school courses on the federal regulation of securities.</p>
      <p> The Securities Lawyer's Deskbook contains the text of the Securities
        Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;1933 Act&quot;), the Securities Exchange
        Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;1934 Act&quot;), the Investment Company
        Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the rules promulgated
        under those Acts, and Regulations S-K, S-B, S-X, S-T, S-P, M-A, FD, M
        and ATS. It also contains the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as
        a printable (PDF) version of the Act and a hyperlinked table of changes
        affected by the Act.</p>
      <p> The data on any page of the Securities Lawyer's Deskbook can be checked
        for incorporation of the latest regulatory or legislative action by reviewing
        the history note at the bottom of each page. The editorial staff regularly
        reviews the files in the Deskbook to keep the text accurate and up to
        date. But those who intend to rely on data in the Securities Lawyer's
        Deskbook must satisfy themselves regarding the accuracy of the information
        in question. </p>
