      	<p><em>&quot;This law school has adapted itself through stages during the past century from a pioneer setting to its present setting in the midst of a populous nation teeming with industry and commerce…&quot;</em> wrote Dean M.L. Ferson, March 1933, <em>Cincinnati Alumnus</em> Magazine</em>.  Over the course of 175 years many landmark events have occurred at the College of Law. In honor of the Anniversary, the law school has installed a timeline, highlighting milestones in our history. If you can’t get to the school to see it, we’ve produced an online version. Take a peek back in time.  </p>
