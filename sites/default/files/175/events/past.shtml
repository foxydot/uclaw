<div class="element atStart">
                
                <p>In fall 2006, Hewlett-Packard became embroiled in a headline-grabbing scandal and disgrace when the media reported that the board had authorized the use of possibly illegal tactics to determine the source of boardroom leaks. Dow Chemical recently announced that it had fired two senior executives for allegedly engaging in unauthorized talks to sell the company.  In 2005 Morgan Stanley replaced its CEO and substantially reshaped its board of directors. What confluence of events can cause governance at highly-regarded corporations to go awry?   This symposium will explore the causes of dysfunctional boards and attempt to formulate some possible cures.</p>
