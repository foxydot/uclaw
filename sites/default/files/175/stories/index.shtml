	<h2>Your Memories</h2>

      	<p>“The richness of our history lies not only in the lineage of deans or the visits of important judges, lawyers and academics, but also in your stories. What was law school like during your era? What was your favorite class and who was your favorite teacher? Would you do it all over again?</p>

		<p>About 50 alumni were interviewed by current law school students in preparation for the anniversary celebration. And, several other alums were interviewed by writer/researcher/historian Jeff Cruikshank, charged with writing the story of our very unique history.  These participants spoke of the College, the faculty, their classmates, and being a lawyer. Take a moment to read their memories, reminisce, and reflect on the law school experience. To make it easier for you to find a colleague, we’ve provided two ways to search: either by class or by last name.  </p>

		<p>Finally, we encourage you to share your memories with us. Your colleagues would enjoy hearing about your life and how the College of Law made a positive impact on you.   To find out how to add your story, just <a href="mailto:COUNSELOR@UC.EDU">email</a> us.</p>
