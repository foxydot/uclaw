				<p>April 30 marked Bill's last class after thirty years at College. Dean Bilionis celebrated the occasion with these words of appreciation:<br />
    			“A dedicated teacher with 30 years of service to the College of Law, Professor Rands is a three-time winner of the Goldman Prize for Excellence in Teaching. His scholarly contributions in the corporate law, corporate finance, and tax areas have been published in well-recognized law reviews through the years .... He has served on and chaired most of the College's standing committees and many ad hoc committees over the years. Those of us who have attended faculty meetings know that he is the living embodiment of our authoritative institutional history and common law.  We are going to miss Professor Rands' wisdom, patient guidance, and unflagging support for the College, but can take comfort that he will be no stranger to us in his well-earned retirement. As many of you are aware, Bill is a dedicated sports fan and we trust that his retirement will provide him with many more opportunities to enjoy his passion to the fullest here in Cincinnati, where he plans to remain.”</p>

			    “I read this earlier & just got off the phone with Steinman after a long talk. Fascinating article & highly recommended. This is very rich. They key insight is Steinman's recognition that the rationale of Gaspareni extends to cases in which two conditions are met: (1) there is a substance-effecting difference between state and federal law, and (2) the federal rule of civil procedure underdetermines the outcome and hence requires "construction" (as opposed to "interpretation") in the technical sense. Very cool. The more controversial implication would be that some federal rules may violate 28 USC Sec. 2072(b) if they are substance affecting. ... If you are interested in procedure, read Steinman!”</p>
