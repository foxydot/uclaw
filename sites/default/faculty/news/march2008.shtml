				<p>Barbara posted Perceptions of Fairness of Securities Arbitration: An Empirical Study (with Jill I. Gross (Pace)), the first empirical study of participants' perceptions of fairness of securities Self-Regulatory Organizations (SRO) arbitrations involving customers. Barbara and Professor Gross drafted and designed the survey, coordinated its mailing, interpreted the data we collected, and prepared the Report, with the technical assistance of Cornell University's Survey Research Institute. They surveyed participants in NASD Dispute Resolution and NYSE arbitrations that were filed from Jan. 1, 2002 through Dec. 31, 2006 and closed between Jan. 1, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2006 and received 3,087 responses (a 13% response rate). Their findings detail that survey participants have divided views about the fairness of securities arbitration and that for almost every question in the survey, customers have a more negative perception of the process than non-customers.</p>

				<p>A preliminary version of the report, which was commissioned by the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration (SICA), was leaked to a Dow Jones reporter, who reported on the study's findings on Feb. 6, and, a day later, SICA released publicly the final report. Since its release, the report has engendered vigorous debate over its findings. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) criticized what it called the study's “middling results, flawed process” (and its focus on subjective perceptions). In contrast, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) praised the study and said that its findings support what state regulators have been hearing from investors in their states -- that they believe the securities arbitration process is “rigged” against them. Other media coverage includes BNA Securities Daily (Feb. 8), Securities Arbitration Alert (Feb. 6, Feb. 20), Investment Executive (Feb. 6), and Investment News (Feb. 6).</p>

				<p>Mark and a volunteer attorney and nine 1L students submitted a 42-page memorandum to Governor Strickland on February 20th, asking for six new laws in Ohio to protect against wrongful convictions. Former AG Jim Petro is acting as a lead lobbyist in working to get these legislative proposals passed into law.</p>

				<p>After a four-year investigation, Mark and students Ashley Couch and Miranda Hamrick filed a 60-page brief in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas seeking the exoneration of OIP client Roger Dean Gillispie. The case involves witness misidentification and police corruption, including Brady violations and tampering with witnesses and other evidence. The following week, the Dayton Daily News printed an editorial demonstrating the paper's support of the OIP's efforts in the case (Case Casts Dark Cloud on Local Justice System, Dayton Daily News, Feb. 18, 2008, at A14.)</p>

				<p>The Columbus Dispatch ran a 5-part series on DNA and wrongful convictions in Ohio at www.dispatch.com/dna. The OIP worked with the Dispatch for more than a year in performing research for the series. The OIP filed more than 20 briefs seeking DNA testing for inmates identified in the articles as inmates who have potentially meritorious DNA claims.</p>
