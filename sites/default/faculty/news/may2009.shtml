              	<p>Mark visited several law schools in China, where he gave a talk on Wrongful Conviction of the Innocent in the United States.  In Beijing, Mark spoke at <a href="http://www.law.ruc.edu.cn/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=15909">Renmin University Law School</a> and <a href="http://www.criminallawbnu.cn/criminal/info/showpage.asp?showhead=&amp;ProgramID=750&amp;pkID=22794&amp;keyword=">Beijing Normal University Law School</a>.  Mark also went to dinner and met informally with faculty and students from both schools. <br />
                  <br />
                  Mark then visited UC's sister law school at Shandong University in Jinan, China.  There, Mark was a visiting scholar, and made presentations and gave seminars on a variety of topics.  Mark also met extensively with criminal law faculty, who discussed with Mark some of China's high profile innocence cases and exonerations in recent years.  Mark also visited the coastal city of Qindao, China, where he met with criminal law faculty from Qindao law school. In Qindao, Mark was hosted by the Deheng Law Firm, a prominent Chinese law firm that specializes in criminal defense.  Mark spoke to the criminal law department of the firm, and went to dinner with the Chairman and several key partners in the criminal justice department where they discussed the possibility of stating an innocence project in China.<br />
                  <br />
                The tour was very helpful to Mark's understanding of how China's criminal justice system handles post-conviction claims of innocence. Mark made numerous contacts that will hopefully pave the way for comparative scholarship, and possibly joint research with Chinese scholars, in the future.</p>
